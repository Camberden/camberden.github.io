	At last, the beginning of my digital blogging page! I've been on a great trajectory since July.
	I am grateful for having had the lucidity of mind to adhere to routines.

	I'm making considerable progress on my site. I almost feel too occupied with it to begin my fall semester classes.
	Regardless, I'll give it a break shortly once this blogging module is successfully given to its own separate page.
	Things seem to be working well: MVP as they'd say. <br>
	Life is funny. More measurable progress is happening in the absense of self-imposed pressures. More so than ever before.
	Fitness, language study, reading, work, and coding: all of these things are going well. Nothing is difficult to approach.
	I feel no anxiety. I am content.
	Though I feel content, I occassionally feel a tinge of longing. Longing for a younger me who would have had this ability:
	the ability to adhere to routines, to generously indulge his creative and academic interests, to express his nature more fully.
	My social life is at a minimum right now, and that is fine. This is an intra-personal time for me.
	For years upon years my overwhelming thoughts and anxieties precluded me from engaging in such activity. 
	The delusion of my youth coupled with my neurodivergence formed within me a rotten value-system hinged upon
	dopaminergic reward. The delusion of my adulthood in my 20's further hinged it upon status and monetary reward.
	Oh the guilt I'd feel when doing ANY activity not for "career" or "financial security!" Every day I'd ask myself 
	whether or not whatever I was doing was WORTH it. 
	I am elated (though calmly) that this is OVER for me. I simply do, for the joy of doing. 
	I do, even when there is nothing to gain. I don't care if there is something to gain.
	True, there are multiple little and large goals tied to my activities, but I am no longer ATTACHED to ANY of them.
	If goals are attained, then cool. If not, okay. Just like you, reality, I'm simply expressing my nature.
	Your nature is to attenuate the coming and going of all activity. 
	My "interests" and whatnot are the means by which I may live skillfully and with finesse; there is a duty assumed
	in expressing my nature to live this life the best I could. I - my form, feelings, perceptions, predilections, and consciousness -
	are merely one lens through which interconnected phenomenal activity is witnessed and realized. 
	Given the choice, and recognizing reality for what it is, why not live more skillfully?
	I will aim myself in that direction, and go, with no destination in mind.
	Freely flowing, I am detached. Detached from the target: suspended in the outset.
	As Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy said: "We need to live in a state of suspended animation, like a work of art, detached, detached."
