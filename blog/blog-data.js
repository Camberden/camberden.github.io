	At last, the beginning of my digital blogging page! I've been on a great trajectory since July.
	I am grateful for having had the lucidity of mind to adhere to routines.

	I'm making considerable progress on my site. I almost feel too occupied with it to begin my fall semester classes.
	Regardless, I'll give it a break shortly once this blogging module is successfully given to its own separate page.
	Things seem to be working well: MVP as they'd say. <hr> &emsp;
	Life is funny. More measurable progress is happening in the absense of self-imposed pressures. More so than ever before.
	Fitness, language study, reading, work, and coding: all of these things are going well. Nothing is difficult to approach.
	I feel no anxiety. I am content.
	Though I feel content, I occassionally feel a tinge of longing. Longing for a younger me who would have had this ability:
	the ability to adhere to routines, to generously indulge his creative and academic interests, to express his nature more fully.
	My social life is at a minimum right now, and that is fine. This is an intra-personal time for me.
	For years upon years my overwhelming thoughts and anxieties precluded me from engaging in such activity. 
	The delusion of my youth coupled with my neurodivergence formed within me a rotten value-system hinged upon
	dopaminergic reward. The delusion of my adulthood in my 20's further hinged it upon status and monetary reward.
	Oh the guilt I'd feel when doing ANY activity not for "career" or "financial security!" Every day I'd ask myself 
	whether or not whatever I was doing was WORTH it. 
	I am elated (though calmly) that this is OVER for me. I simply do, for the joy of doing. 
	I do, even when there is nothing to gain. I don't care if there is something to gain.
	True, there are multiple little and large goals tied to my activities, but I am no longer ATTACHED to ANY of them.
	If goals are attained, then cool. If not, okay. Just like you, reality, I'm simply expressing my nature.
	Your nature is to attenuate the coming and going of all activity. 
	My "interests" and whatnot are the means by which I may live skillfully and with finesse; there is a duty assumed
	in expressing my nature to live this life the best I could. I - my form, feelings, perceptions, predilections, and consciousness -
	are merely one lens through which interconnected phenomenal activity is witnessed and realized. 
	Given the choice, and recognizing reality for what it is, why not live more skillfully?
	I will aim myself in that direction, and go, with no destination in mind.
	Freely flowing, I am detached. Detached from the target: suspended in the outset.
	As Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy said: "We need to live in a state of suspended animation, like a work of art, detached, detached."

	I've being doing okay this weekend, though a bit somber at having missed out on a lot of sunshine and opportunity for
	hiking or long walks. I've gotten over a week ahead on my coursework, and have been continually doing other activities
	relevant to me, such as coding and language practice. There's still so much that deserves time. Even though I've
	done well to restrict my interests, they at times seem too numerous. <hr> &emsp;
	I decided to drop the Business Law course because I did not want to be overburdened by coursework for these next few
	months. Gladly I will be getting a full refund, and will be able to better balance personal interests, work, and health.
	That extra course would have surely affected my mental health negatively in retrospect. Am I in no rush, after all.
	My lateral move will happen at some point, likely around late 2026. By then I will be more than ready for entry-level.
	Would I not like to enjoy the income and vacation time that my current position affords me during 2026 and perhaps beyond?
	It would be sensible, when of course I am free from SAL. So, overall: I will be selecting one and only one course per
	semester. Were I to take off most of summer 2026, I may do more; such classes then would be mostly prose/legal/reading.<hr>
	I pushed my Laravel project again. I enabled CSS and images by moving such files to the 'Public' directory and interpolating
	in the blades as {{'asset(/css/app.css')}} for instance. I had to update database credentials in the .env file. 
	For sql, I needed to mysql -uroot following reset and follow mysql_secure_installation instructions.

	Almost finished with another eighty-hour work-week. I'm grateful to have been enjoying work very much.
	Even so, I maintain managaged enthusiasm for my intended career change, and am learning to better interweave that
	enthusiasm in my current position through stressing oft-overlooked procedures and offering solutions to streamline
	operations across shifts and teams. I anticipate my learning journey with coding to manifest my idea for a simple
	pay and pension prediction utility once I gain enough confidence in Laravel and attain the ability to deploy on an
	internet-accessible server, cloud or not.
	<hr> &emsp;
	I wouldn't say I have too many interests or anything, but the amount of creative things I want to do can seem like much 
	though not to an overwhelming degree that would cause me to freeze up like I have prior to my brain's software update, 
	so to speak. I would like to gain a modest competence in creating digital assets, in producing music again, in font design,
	in simple game design (likely educational), in video creation, among others that may arise as this worldly self further 
	develops. 
	<hr> &emsp;
	I've learned through writing the pension calculator about document.getElementById("").children.item(#) which will be 
	able to target and access the nth index tag within the gotten element's child. Cool! I can't wait to see how these all
	work with database connectivity through Laravel. Well, I actually can wait, and will. 
	<hr> &emsp;
	I am secure; I am safe; I am content. 
	Missu.
