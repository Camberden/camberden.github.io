	At last, <b-title>the beginning</b-title> of my digital blogging page! I've been on a great trajectory since July.
	I am grateful for having had the lucidity of mind to adhere to routines.

	I'm making considerable progress on my site. I almost feel too occupied with it to begin my fall semester classes.
	Regardless, I'll give it a break shortly once this blogging module is successfully given to its own separate page.
	Things seem to be working well: MVP as they'd say. <hr> &emsp;
	Life is funny. More measurable progress is happening in the absense of self-imposed pressures. More so than ever before.
	Fitness, language study, reading, work, and coding: all of these things are going well. Nothing is difficult to approach.
	I feel no anxiety. I am content.
	Though I feel content, I occassionally feel a tinge of longing. Longing for a younger me who would have had this ability:
	the ability to adhere to routines, to generously indulge his creative and academic interests, to express his nature more fully.
	My social life is at a minimum right now, and that is fine. This is an intra-personal time for me.
	For years upon years my overwhelming thoughts and anxieties precluded me from engaging in such activity. 
	The delusion of my youth coupled with my neurodivergence formed within me a rotten value-system hinged upon
	dopaminergic reward. The delusion of my adulthood in my 20's further hinged it upon status and monetary reward.
	Oh the guilt I'd feel when doing ANY activity not for "career" or "financial security!" Every day I'd ask myself 
	whether or not whatever I was doing was WORTH it. 
	I am elated (though calmly) that this is OVER for me. I simply do, for the joy of doing. 
	I do, even when there is nothing to gain. I don't care if there is something to gain.
	True, there are multiple little and large goals <b-title>tied to my activities</b-title>, but I am no longer ATTACHED to ANY of them.
	If goals are attained, then cool. If not, okay. Just like you, reality, I'm simply expressing my nature.
	Your nature is to attenuate the coming and going of all activity. 
	My "interests" and whatnot are the means by which I may live skillfully and with finesse; there is a duty assumed
	in expressing my nature to live this life the best I could. I - my form, feelings, perceptions, predilections, and consciousness -
	are merely one lens through which interconnected phenomenal activity is witnessed and realized. 
	Given the choice, and recognizing reality for what it is, why not live more skillfully?
	I will aim myself in that direction, and go, with no destination in mind.
	Freely flowing, I am detached. Detached from the target: suspended in the outset.
	As Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy said: "We need to live in a state of suspended animation, like a work of art, detached, detached."

	I've being doing okay this weekend, though a bit somber at having missed out on a lot of sunshine and opportunity for
	hiking or long walks. I've gotten <b-title>over a week ahead</b-title> on my coursework, and have been continually doing other activities
	relevant to me, such as coding and language practice. There's still so much that deserves time. Even though I've
	done well to restrict my interests, they at times seem too numerous. <hr> &emsp;
	I decided to drop the Business Law course because I did not want to be overburdened by coursework for these next few
	months. Gladly I will be getting a full refund, and will be able to better balance personal interests, work, and health.
	That extra course would have surely affected my mental health negatively in retrospect. Am I in no rush, after all.
	My lateral move will happen at some point, likely around late 2026. By then I will be more than ready for entry-level.
	Would I not like to enjoy the income and vacation time that my current position affords me during 2026 and perhaps beyond?
	It would be sensible, when of course I am free from SAL. So, overall: I will be selecting one and only one course per
	semester. Were I to take off most of summer 2026, I may do more; such classes then would be mostly prose/legal/reading.<hr>
	I pushed my Laravel project again. I enabled CSS and images by moving such files to the 'Public' directory and interpolating
	in the blades as {{'asset(/css/app.css')}} for instance. I had to update database credentials in the .env file. 
	For sql, I needed to mysql -uroot following reset and follow mysql_secure_installation instructions.

	Almost finished with another eighty-hour work-week. I'm grateful to have been enjoying work very much.
	Even so, I maintain <b-title>managed enthusiasm</b-title> for my intended career change, and am learning to better interweave that
	enthusiasm in my current position through stressing oft-overlooked procedures and offering solutions to streamline
	operations across shifts and teams. I anticipate my learning journey with coding to manifest my idea for a simple
	pay and pension prediction utility once I gain enough confidence in Laravel and attain the ability to deploy on an
	internet-accessible server, cloud or not.
	<hr> &emsp;
	I wouldn't say I have too many interests or anything, but the amount of creative things I want to do can seem like much 
	though not to an overwhelming degree that would cause me to freeze up like I have prior to my brain's software update, 
	so to speak. I would like to gain a modest competence in creating digital assets, in producing music again, in font design,
	in simple game design (likely educational), in video creation, among others that may arise as this worldly self further 
	develops. 
	<hr> &emsp;
	I've learned through writing the pension calculator about document.getElementById("").children.item(#) which will be 
	able to target and access the nth index tag within the gotten element's child. Cool! I can't wait to see how these all
	work with database connectivity through Laravel. Well, I actually can wait, and will. 
	<hr> &emsp;
	I am secure; I am safe; I am content. 
	Missu.

	So, though I have been doing okay for myself, I am experiencing old pangs of inadequacy. I attribute this to the return flight.
	Thoughts have arisen and continually arise of my 'not having amounted to enough' to merit the continuation of what we had.
	After years of having been reassured that this wasn't an issue, it had seemingly become among the reasons for separation.
	I become confused and question where I had made mistakes. Though I could say that I should have followed my gut feeling, it stands
	true that I am blessed with a very decent situation now, at least intra-personally. I mustn't forget that this course of events
	was possible because I had not acted on that gut feeling, and instead chose loyalty. This suffering I am enduring now exists 
	undertoned by the relief of it, for myself and for others. I take solace in this realization. Nonetheless, the sensation is 
	<b-title>emotionally burdensome</b-title>. I aim to act well as things become situated again, but I hold a sense that I would become excessively
	cautious with my speech to the extent it could be considered 'masking.' Such masking surely wouldn't be healthy for me.
	<hr>
	I'm going to put on a smile as I approach my tomorrow, and power through. I am tired. That is fine.

	It still holds true that <b-title>community integration</b-title> for me is difficult. 
	On occasion I find myself disheartened by repeated acceptance that so little works with my schedule.
	One activity after the next, one event after the next, one person after the next; 
	I am unable to conform to externally sourced routines with any sort of socially expected consistency. 
	My schedule is something I enjoy, but no longer wish to maintain long-term; 
	I recall "wishing" I'd have this type of schedule, and that a 12-hour shift would be the best balance between too much and too little. 
	It's not only the length or frequency of shifts that causes difficulty, 
	it's that my off days are inconsistent on a week-by-week basis, 
	a basis that would be helpful in establishing myself as a reliable regular both online and in-person.
	Being more reliably regular seems to be the best for developing one's sense of community, especially within third spaces.
	<hr>
	I affirm that there can be multiple "selves" through which one's life is lived. 
	My experience has shown me that the Chrispy of 2018 who highly desired such a lifestyle is simply not the Chrispy of 2024.
	Though "I" share the same life-lens as that previous self,  I couldn't agree that that person is "me" or the present self.
	My identities and values have shifted quite dramatically since; the actions taken previously I now consider unthinkable.
	College debt, liberal arts, fast food, luxury goods etc.

	The weekend began with an overhaul of my digital security across all licenses and websites. I am surprised at just how much peace
	of mind that afforded me; I suppose it's due to an increased feeling control over my life for years to come, especially as I 
	increase my time sitting in front of a computer. I've uncovered most of my previously used email accounts and discovered many files
	and projects my previous selves created including videos, music, college papers, and even silly poems like "Vanilla FOrmula."
	Aside from things uncovered online, I plugged in my old external harddrive from undergrad, and uncovered my trashed iMac's backup
	from 2014. Inside, I found more even files to include plugins (like Magic 8-bit Plugin), my Japanese class video recordings,
	Minecraft multiplayer clips, old desktop screencaps, and albums that got me through my early college years. 
	I was really hoping to find my Finale music program files from 2007-2010 but sadly they're not present. Some compositions I forgot,
	like Mission Themes I and II, Floccinaucinilipilificated Tune, and Organ Composition I (my first produced tune).
	Needless to say, I'm <b-title>feeling the nostalgia</b-title> of that time, though I affirm that I am content in my current place in life.
	<hr>
	During this time, I have successfully reloaded all my music plugins into my DAW, Logic Pro. Having been programming consistently, my DAW
	and its tools have become much easier to manage. I can now see the sense in how many parameters are interconnected and can muster
	the patience to learn the features that go beyond simply inputting MIDI data. My curiosity for what lies underneath the raw musicality 
	of the production process is actually alive. In years past, I'd hardly care. All of my interests are inteweaving at large, it seems.
	While typing this, I'm listening to videos on VST design. Heck, I could even consider making my own software synth plugins someday, 
	were I to engage dabble with C++ or Rust. Again, something to consider, nothing to involve myself deeply into at this time. 
	I must be wary to keep my interests limited, because at times lately I've noticed that I could overwhelm myself with new creative avenues to 
	explore. My time is limited. I long for weeks or months at a time where I can better catch up to who I could have become. Putting it that
	way seems a bit remorseful, rather, I long for weeks or months at a time where I can become who I will to be. I intend at nothing groundbreaking,
	but just will to aim my life skillfully.
	<hr>
	Overall, I'm feeling okay. It's been a decent weekend so far, and I would like to produce a little thing shortly and place it on my website.
	I also would like to update the music page, and add a few more tracks. I should sort all lists by year. I should also update the dashboard 
	and use a different border style site-wide, because on mobile some borders do not appear properly. In addition, I want my JLPT page to 
	be able to prompt a Jisho iFrame by marshalling a chosen word to its URI query. This way, I could essentially use it as an API without
	a direct external call which would be permissible by github pages.
	<hr>
	Work is going okay. I'm definitely improving in my role and am happy to have really established myself. I'm grateful to know that I am secure,
	and with that security my peace of mind is maintained. Randomly I feel uneasy about American politics and economy and it escalates to
	active worrying about societal collapse. This peace I enjoy, like all things, is impermanent. I need to keep working and fulfill my 
	financial obligations, because only then would I no longer be shackled to this geopolitical division where the negatives to exacerbate.
	The worry materialized into my having created that Travel Log page to include retirement ideas. I can live on little, now moreso than
	ever. I am concerned that others may follow a very frugal path, which, though potentially beneficial for individuals' lives, would 
	leave a negative impact on the economy if there are fewer and fewer consumers out there. If more desires are purged, then there would
	be fewer jobs geared towards fabricating desire and towards peddling goods for which such desire is fabricated. I am hopeful this 
	modern world, in all its good and bad, is at least able to avoid collapse. A glipse of collapse would surely increase my consideration
	for taking a stint at Antaiji.

	October has been fine so far. I began a vacation which manifested as a staycation, more or less. Anxieties have arisen, possibly due to 
	the continuation of the acceptable mundane for me. There was little to break the monotony throughout the time; only one day remains.
	I began my Friday with a mind flooding with fanciful ideas of international travel, car rentals, and beach-bound trips. Perhaps I had
	gotten a bit too attached to the broad idea of "going somewhere far away." To add, I had consistent self-imposed pressure to adjust my schedule
	to the daytime which I had not been able to do successfully. These led to confusion resulting in <b-title>exacerbated executive dysfunction</b-title> and a 
	disruption to my sense of peace. I need to be careful; I need to reflect more, and I need to clear my head more. It is evident that ideas
	and thoughts have become too numerous. It is for that very reason I previously determined that I must remain consistent with my emptiness practice.
	<hr>
	I prefaced by saying that this month has been fine. I had made considerable strides in programming and coursework. I am glad to have
	gotten full CRUD working in Laravel and had learned Rust basics. I should not forget <code>{{auth()->user()->name}}</code> for direct
	session user name access. I've also been pushing forward with the Accounting page and it's almost at the point where I could use it a as
	a passive study tool as I desire for it to become. I mustn't forget that any modules I make on the github.io can be ported over to 
	Laravel or other frameworks that would permit independent server hosting and deployment such that I could integrate user profiles, saving,
	and other database-enabled services.
	<hr>
	As I have many times in the past, I should see the positives in my not having traveled far away during these seven days. No Home in PA,
	Outer Banks in NC, Bogotá in Colombia, or Baggs in Wyoming, heheh. Just here. Things are fine. Financially, I must be mindful of increased
	burden for the next year. Yes, I have been mindful of finances and saving very much, but I have a feeling that I will have to maintain the
	stronger sense of frugality throughout 2025; I do not want this staycation to leave me attached to the idea of consistent vacationing.
	I need to keep my income high, and to do that, I must fulfill my monthly work obligations with minimal leave taken. Besides, my leave accrual
	will ensure that my quotas are loaded up and ready to go for calendar year 2026! I have a lot to look forward to. The funny thing I'm realizing
	is that people will always find something to become dissatisfied with, and even someone such as myself armed with detachment practices can
	fall victim from time to time. All is fine, all is empty. Even if I were shackled for life, what should preclude me from experiencing the 
	present moment positively?

	Earlier today I recited the "Merging of Difference and Unity" in group. There's a line towards the end that struck a chord with me when I
	first read it, and now, it came to the forefront of my mind: "Progress is not a matter of far or near, but if you are confused mountains and
	rivers block the way." I was certainly confused about many things ranging from small to large. Should I travel? Should I stay? Should I 
	reach out to others? Should I remain focused on personal endeavors? Am I picking up too many endeavors? What should I eliminate? 
	Should I consider leaving in the long term? Staying near? Shall I take more leave, or work more?
	Will I back home for the long term? Should I give up everything, or cling to few things? Shall I fly solo or have a companion?
	Should I be loyal to people, or is no one but myself worth trusting? Should I concern myself with heated world affairs?
	Shall I have such affairs influence where I take myself?
	Do I enjoy my work, or do I revile it? Am I dwelling too much in the future at the moment, or am I being responsible in doing so?
	<hr>
	Yet again in life, I'm forced to consider another move. Yet another move. My relocation to this place felt so right, and I do enjoy it, but
	I must be responsible and achieve my freedom, and aiming towards that steadily would require another drastic action. I have some plans.
	There is no plan that doesn't involve sacrifice of some sort. I am hopeful that I am mentally prepared for detaching to some of the 
	conveniences life has afforded me at this location. I know I can do this. I need to go with the flow of life as it presents itself to me.
	I know this. I should settle on a course of action for 2025. Firstly, I must be able to see all options available to me. 
	The debt of my past as a naive student is almost wholly paid; alas, it follows me to 2025 and affects where I will end up for that year.
	It's not much longer. I can do this. Right now, I must dispell this confusion a bit more such that the <b-title>mountains and rivers</b-title> aren't 
	blocking the way. Indeed, I should knock out Test 2. I must dedicate one off day ahead to completing the financially rewarding 
	progression program. I need to recover and unburden myself to see a path more clearly. I know what I must do.

	I spend a work shift at my first assignment location for my current role. I was quite apprehensive at first, but upon getting settled in,
	it was okay. Nonetheless, memories both good and bad had surfaced. I was given a moment to reflect and to but my life into perspective:
	I surely had come a long way, and I'm grateful for how my life had turned out. The fires, floods, and blood are no longer a frequent
	dealing of mine because I had taken action. I recalled those make-or-break moments I had. The anxieties and stresses of that time
	were necessary, and really put things into perspective. I appeared at briefing, and it was like a dream, seeing the old team still
	kicking. Still making it happen. They affirm that they just need people. More people on the team, just like when I started. I miss the
	days when we were stacked. I felt so pumped up to learn and to run that joint, every day, knowing we had almost 50 total people on
	shift. Sadly such is not the case now, and while yes, they need people, and they were refreshed to see me returning again, I am 
	certainly not considering returning, and I'm sure they all knew that. I have a feeling that I may be perceived as an inspiration
	for staff there to change their situation, and that management is aware of that. I feel such would be perogative for management
	to keep me more separated from staff. Anywho, I'm grateful for having had the opportunity to revisit and to glean this perspective.
	<hr>
	I'm going to do some homework tonight, and give this digital nomad location browsing a little break. After all, it's my accounting
	studies that will help enable that lifestyle down the road. In this moment, I am feeling quite roasty inside. Ever since the return
	flight, I've not kept up with my routines and principles as well. But no worries, I can get the ball rolling again, so to speak.
	My routines and such will be quite different when 2025 rolls around, but I know something will work out. I have faith.
	I am confident in making another move; I've done it many times before and can do it again of course. My moves have led to successes.
	Though I'm a little saddened to leave this place, I understand that there is no absolute. I honestly have become attached to this 
	place, and still affirm that it is amazing for my needs, but it's a time to detach again and to put my mindset into action. 
	It's all impermanent, just like my time at that rough location. I can relinquish negatives and I can 
	<b-title>relinquish positives</b-title>.

	My headspace lately has been discordant. I am preparing for a move and nearly finished with this class. 
	I have had more responsibilities at work which are tolerable but not particularly desired.
	My health has been poor, not only because of family and friend visits but because of lackluster discipline on
	any given day. My loss of workout routine has made way for excess consumption, passivity, and general carelessness to creep.
	My proactivity has dwindled drastically. 
	<hr>
	I am writing now such that I may take note of these problems, and because I have procrastiated on physically writing an entry for weeks: 
	I am in trouble. I need to force a fast or some sort of detox to get back on track. 
	I must avoid specific things I know to cause me harm: cereals are no good, sugary foods including ice cream are no good, eating 
	near midnight in general is no good. I must encourage specific things that I know to benefit me: <b-title>high protein</b-title> upon waking, 
	diversified caffeine sources, and fitting some sort of exercise in no matter what.
	<hr>
	With the above in mind, I am hopeful to recover my better mode of being that I experienced when making this blog.
	I surely have the means to do so; this is merely another ebb of the flow of my life. I recall around this time last year I endured
	a similar situation with regard to self-care. Meh. In that case and in all other cases, I was able to recover and feel the 
	zest for life. After all, simply being is to endure both the lows and the highs. Otherwise being is not being as it is known to be.
	Heh heh.
