Alright, so I essentially ruined a relationship very important to me.
The first question is, what went wrong? Naturally, I must look inwardly. 
First thing of course, I failed to prioritize. I made it clear from the beginning that I may find difficulty in that during the course of my life in my current situation I may find it difficult to give back in ways I know I should. I was showered with gifts and affection I had long lived without, and it surprised me so much. I didn't think I would've deserved all of it. It turns out that, yes, I was correct. I was undeserving. It was the wrong time. Just as it was with the one before. I can blame my redemption journey all I want, but there's no use to that. I need to be aware of my time. 

The software addiction shall end today. I shall not invest my time into this as I have. I will return to practice. I will return to health. I will return to a better form of myself as I lived during the summer of 2024. I miss myself. This computer nerd correctional officer is not a better self. I have demonstrated failures in character to include inability to change lifestyle habits and inability to reciprocate the genuine expressions of care. 

I will not have anyone else close to me endure that level of discomfort again. I must affirm this change. 

I will recover my better self for myself, first and foremost. I mustn't forget that even though the substance of this issue is an interpersonal one. 

My better self does not need to include this software hobby, anymore. There is no future in this for me. Part of my obsession lately is certainly the off-change ideation of a potential career pivot to something related to software. While, yes, it can be related, it will not be wholly involved in the craft to the same degree it is with building out my ideas. I must acknowledge this. Accounting offers a pathway to something more comfortable, but I must acknowledge it as solely that alone: a comfortable state of being. 

I must come forth with some straight-forward admissions of failure. I will create a list shortly.
- I invested in my own tech products over investing in having memorable experiences. I tenaciously conditioned myself to believe that this time was temporary and was meant for the hustle. As such, I rationalized my addition to learning new skills as part of a grand upskill effort. 
- I could have taken effort to share more activities with my friend.

As part of ending this addiction track, I will reduce my digital footprint as it's concerned with my personal projects. I must abandon some of these ever-growing goals that are empty in the end. Empty beyond empty. Killed time. Killed experience. Dead life, lived, stagnant in front of a computer. I realize that, for ==others who spend plenty time in front of a computer for work, it's not awfully appealing to do the same passively often in their company==. I will remember this point.
