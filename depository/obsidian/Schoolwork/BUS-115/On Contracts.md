So when it comes to contracts, let's remember these three points:

1. Is it certain that the defendant promised to do something?

2. If the defendant did make a promise, is it fair to make them honor their word?

3. If the defendant did not make a promise, are there unusual reasons to hold them liable anyway?

Enforceable without Consideration:
- Promises that induce detrimental reliance, under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, are an exception to the rule that only promises supported by consideration are enforceable. There must be a clear and definite promise, the promisor should have expected that the promisee would rely on the promise, the promisee reasonably relied on the promise by acting or refraining from some act, the promisee’s reliance was definite and resulted in substantial detriment, and enforcement of the promise is necessary to avoid injustice.
- Promises to pay debts barred by a statute of limitations
- Promises to donate to charity

Uniform Commercial Code:
- Article 2: shares of stock are not "goods."

To officiate a Contract:
- offer
- acceptance
- consideration
- contractual capacity
- legality
- consent
- writing

Contract Types:
- Unilateral: one side is promised something
 - e.g. Lost dog poster on telephone pole
- Bilateral: both agree to arragement
- Formal: officiated 
- Executed: both had fulfilled (done)
