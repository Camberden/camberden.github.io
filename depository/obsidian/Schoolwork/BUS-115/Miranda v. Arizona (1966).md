This case made it necessary to read rights during arrest: that individuals have the right to remain silent. 

1. What constitutional rights does the video discuss?
	-  This video details an arrestee's right to remain silent during a criminal case and the arrestee's right to an attorney during a trial, both of which are referenced in the Constitution respectively but are specified in the case law, #miranda-v-arizona-1966 .
	- The Miranda rights have been since been "embedded in the national culture" as Chief Justice William Rehnquist had said, and can be considered a hallmark of the American criminal justice process being that it is among the most well known case laws. The video had mentioned near its end that the framers of associated laws wanted the criminal conviction process to be difficult *but not impossible* to not only convict but also to deprive people of their liberties. 
2. What did you learn about interrogations?
	- I learned that the "Star Chamber" in England had been in memory throughout the West as an accusatory system whereby someone accused had no recourse during interrogation and will face harsh punitive action regardless of disposition and findings. One could say that this instance is a manifestation of criminal justice from which the American criminal justice system had, since inception, aimed to diverge for the sake of protecting human dignity. Interrogations can be conducted in an aggressive manner in order to compel confession, and some dishonesty arises. As in the case of Miranda, he was selected from a lineup and told that he was recognized the perpetrator though such was not the case. Interrogators certainly relied, even implicitly, on the expectation of a suspect's ignorance of rights to more swiftly reach confession; it's such ignorance that the Miranda rights exist to erase.
3. What did you learn about your rights in a criminal trial?
	- I learned that my rights endure at the instance of arrest and throughout the subsequent proceedings and criminal trial. I am reaffirmed that having been read Miranda rights is not a suggestion but a requirement by law enforcement in order for subsequent interrogation and proceedings to be legitimized in the courts. I can not only have an attorney appointed to me during a case, but also I could have an attorney sit with me during the interrogation process, whether inside or outside an interrogation room. Essentially, I would not be compelled to speak and have the right to lawyer who may solely speak on my behalf. 
4. What surprised you most about the video?
	-  I was surprised to discover that the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney are codified separately in the Constitution. This case is an instance of a citation of multiple separate Amendments in the Constitution that creates nationally applicable, constitutionally-blended law such as reading the Miranda rights. I was further surprised to see that there was very much public backlash against this case during its hearings and oral arguments. Despite that presently this case law is so well known and "embedded in the national culture,"  it was only passed 5-4 in the Supreme Court with opposition, including President Nixon, that claimed that such law would favor criminals and halt law enforcement in conducting its duties, interrogation included. The video's reiteration of the concept of an interrogation as  "designed to develop an admission of guilt" and thus includes techniques to reach that end; one could argue that such an end goal is a diversion from the assumption of innocence until proven guilty.
5. Why are the warnings before an interrogation called Miranda warnings or Miranda rights?
	- There are named for Ernesto Miranda who, in his case #miranda-v-arizona-1966, was brought to a confession during a series of police interrogations. They are specific to this case because of the blended nature of the rights associated with it. As they are not codified in a single statutory law or Amendment of the Constitution, these rights are specifically outlined with reference to its case law. The Sixth Amendment details the right to an attorney during the criminal proceedings, and the Fifth Amendment details covers free speech. Even so, interrogation and police inquiry could proceed without an attorney and could compel speech through aggressive techniques. As long as a confession was brought forth, then the prosecution maintained all leverage. This specific case ensures that awareness of the rights during the process are established at the outset as measure to ensure that individuals are provided adequate protections from self-incrimination.
