## Extra Credit Assignment
*This assignment is due before 11:59 pm Sunday, May 3rd. Adds 4 points to your final grade.

The purpose of the Current Event report is to keep you interested in the ethical and legal news that surrounds us every day. This is an EXTRA CREDIT assignment. It is not mandatory.

To complete this project, you should either watch the local or national news (BBC, PBS, NPR, CNN, Headline News, , and local stations such as CBS, ABC, and NBC and so on) or read the newspaper (NY Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, or local papers such as the News and Observer and so on) or read news journals (The Economist, Business Week, Forbes, Time, Newsweek, FOX, RealClearPolitics.com and so on) and find a CURRENT EVENT on which to report. This is a current event assignment, so the STORY on the event must have been **PUBLISHED DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS.** The event or story can be based on something that happened in the past, but the story needs to be published this semester. The event must have something to do with BUSINESS LAW and what we have covered in this class. This event may be a crime, but only if a BUSINESS is somehow involved in the crime.

## Instructions

 Choose a current event that interests you. Find 3 news articles on that topic from three different news sources. Each news article should have been _published_ sometime during THE LAST TWO YEARS. Use these articles to write one current event report focused on the topic you chose. Follow the directions below to write your current event report.
 
Your CER should be at least 5 paragraphs long and no more than 3 pages.
Make sure your spelling, grammar, and punctuation are correct.

Your current event report (CER) should summarize your topic in one paragraph and then address the following in 4-6 more paragraphs:
