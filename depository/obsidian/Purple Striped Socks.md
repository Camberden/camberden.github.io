So one reason I accepted hospital duty today was that I am wearing purple and white striped stockings. Heck. I wore them earlier to keep my legs warm and forgot to change them out before work since I had sillily put on my boots much earlier, thinking that I would take them off. Well I didn't. 
Anyways, I really need to structure my goals for this whole web dev stuff. I'm overwhelmed and kinda tired of all this. I want to be free, but I want to ensure this is all built up the way I want it. Heck. Might just have to migrate camberden.com to the shared hosting space. I should finish this out and begin the grind yknow. 
Here's a list of web dev goals:

	- [ ] Anki Decks
