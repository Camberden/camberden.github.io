So while toying with all these new apps, I missed up a git push and erased my static website. Gladly I was able to revert it, but still, what a setback! Adding files to the git exclusion rules then deleting content not to push didn't suffice; it simply overwrote everything but the obsidian markdown. Heh. I will probably not end up pushing to github through #GitSync anymore.

In any case, there are a few things I would need to do upon getting out of this hospital:
- [x] Get Obsidian Desktop
- [x] Check Obsidian Desktop's Exclusion Rules
- [x] Get the Obsidian config file
- [x] Consider remote server connection for file offload. 
- [x] Amazon =>
	- [x] Key Reels
	- [x] Consider RaspberryPi
