24	Another day...
26	I'm all alone
30	I wonder what to do again...
31	I take a seat,
32	then I endure
33	cascading flows of thoughts and so I
34	freeze again
35	paralyzed...
36	directionless and overwhelmed
37	I close my eyes...
38	fostering the will to take my leave
44	...
50	I understand
53	my perseverence
56	is fielding over much to many
59	things to do...
62	and people with whom
65	my anxiousness and social withdraw
68	disunite.
71	This inner fight
75	brings isolation speaking naught.
78	I steal away...
81	and lock myself inside this state of mind.
100	My soul!
103	It comes alive!
106	For just this night!
109	I realize is just for now!
112	I do surmise a lack of meaning
115	to come...
118	from what I do,
121	the day by day,
125	the black and grey
128	the solidude,
131	this mental cage
134	I do surmise a lack of meaning
137	to me...
