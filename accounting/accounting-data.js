	A Fiscal-Year determines annual reporting dues. They could be the calendar year, a 52-week period, or 12 consecutive months. NC is July 1st to June 30th.

Adjustments keep it such that Revenues are recorded when services are actually provided. Expenses shall recorded in the same manner; this is "Matching." This conforms to GAAP.

4 Adjustments: deferral of expense, revenue; accrued expense, revenue

1. Determine what current account balance equals
2. Determine what the current account balance should equal.
3. Record an adjusting entry to get from step 1 to step 2

Journalize an ADJUSTING ENTRY at the end of an accounting period.

CREATE expense account from which to send adjustments of a Prepaid or Current Asset Account. This is "Expensing" of current assets. Supplies are counted just like inmates at the end. The EXPENSE is the DEBIT. The credits to the Asset Account are credited at the End-Of-Month and are the same as the debits of the corresponding Expense Account.

Plant Assets (Property, Plant, and Equipment; PP&E).  
Longterm and tangible. Depreciating longer term assets.  
They have a "useful life." Should last for over a YEAR.

Accrued expenses are Accrued liabilities, incurred in a period that are both unpaid and unrecorded.

Accrued Expenses are Liabilities:

* increases a liability increases expense in Income Statement
* increases Liability, Balance Sheet accounting

At the end of month, employees may be paid but the days between payment and end-of-month must be recorded.

Salaries expense must be days x daily rate.  
Salaries payable must increase.

The Closing Entries:

The revenues, expenses, and dividends "disappear" through the closing of those accounts from the adjusted trail balance. Revenues, expenses, dividends, and income summary accounts are TEMPORARY accounts that do not appear in the Post-Closing Trial Balance.

Income summary is the footer to revenues and the header to the expenses. Then, in the third entry, it itself is closed by crediting retained earnings. Finally, retained earnings less dividends closes the final step of closing. 

Accounting Cycle:

The order of steps in creating financial statements. It's a cycle because it's all repeated every closing period.

1\. Analyze transactions

2\. Journalize

3\. Post

4\. Prepare Unadjusted Trial-Balance

5\. Adjust and post accounts

6\. Prepare Adjusted Trial-Balance

7\. Prepare financial statements

8\. Close Accounts

9\. Prepare Post-Closing Trial Balance

(10). Reverse and Post (Optional)

<mark class="formula">Profit Margin = netIncome / netSales</mark>

18000 / 90000 previous year 20%

20000 / 100000 current year: 20%

<mark class="formula">Current Ratio = currentAssets / currentLiabilities;</mark>

A currentRatio of < .1 = doubt on paying back debt!

A WorkSheet is created BEFORE END OF PERIOD & BEFORE THE ADJUSTING PROCESS. This aids in the preparation of financial statements.

Steps:

1\. Account # ; Unadjusted Trial Balance Debits and Credits (their balances)

2\. Enter Adjustments

3\. Prepare the Adjusted Trial Balance

4\. Sorting from Adjusted Trial Balance to both Income Statement and Balance Sheet

Expenses go to Income Statement Debit column

Revenues go to the Income Statement Credit column

Assets and Dividends to the Balance Sheet Debit column

Liabilities, Accumulated Depreciation, Common Stock, Retained Earnings, go to the Balance Sheet Credit column

  

Classified/Unclassified Balance Sheets

Operating Cycle: time between performance of services to collecting cash; most operating cycles are less that one year. Cycles are used to decide which assets and liabilities are CURRENT. At a minimum, a Classified Balance Sheet distinguishes CURRENT (within Operating Cycle) and NON-CURRENT (outside of it).

Unclassified: broadly groups assets, liabilities, and equity.

Classified: Lists current BEFORE non-current; items in CURRENT are listed in order by how QUICKLY they will be converted to or PAID IN CASH.

On Classified Balance Sheet:

Current Assets: are: 

 Cash and other assets expected to be sold, collected, or used within 1 year or the company's operating cycle, whichever is longer: examples: cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, short-term notes receivable, prepaid-expenses, SUPPLIES, goods for sale "merchandise" or "inventory."

Non-Current Assets: are:

Long-Term-Investments: expected to be held for more than one year; this includes longer-term NOTES RECEIVABLE & investments in stocks and bonds. There can be short-term notes receivable but they are current assets.

Plant assets like equipment, buildings, and land.

Intangible Assets: trademarks, patents, copyrights, franchises, good-will.

Equity is NOT separated into current and non-current categories.


\----- Smart-book Question Notes:

Supplies are a pre-paid asset.

Debit the unpaid salaries.

Unearned Revenue: cash is received in advance for services. They are reported on the balance sheet.

Up the Cash; Credit the Unearned Revenue (a LIABILITY) ; ON ADJUSTMENT: Debit the Unearned Revenue portion and credit the Earned Revenue as it comes. Because Cash Asset was Debited, to balance the sheet, the other side must become fully credited. Consulting revenue will become fully credited. The liability of Unearned becomes equity of Earned.

Banker's Rule: Interest computations use a 360-day year.

Accrued Revenue: increase a revenue; increase an asset.

Accrued Interest Revenue: debit Interest Receivable; credit Interest Revenue.

EVERY ADJUSTING ENTRY: affects 1 Income Statement Account (Revenue or Expense) and 1 Balance Sheet Account (Asset or Liability)!

Unearned Stuff? You're CREATING a Liability! Balance that with an income statement account (expense). Then, debits before credits; liabilities are credit-normal.

Adjusting Entries are due at the end of an accounting period, therefore, equipment bought in the middle of the year would require adjustment.

Adjusted Trial Balance would typically have more accounts listed because some accounts are changed during adjustment, for instance, Accumulated Depreciation, Salaries Payable, and Supplies Expense

Temporary Account: relate to one accounting period, such as Income Statement Accounts (expense, revenue), Dividends Account, and the Income Summary Account. CLOSING PROCESS APPLIES TO ONLY TEMPORARY ACCOUNTS. Temporary Accounts are closed to Zero.

HOMEWORK

Recognizing Expenses
A prepaid expenses like hotel rooms for a following month is not recognized in Accrual Based Accounting as for the current period. Prepaid asset?

Prepaid Assets like Prepaid Insurance:
determine current balance, determine what it should be, adjust from step 1 to step 2. Current = 5000, Payments show 1000 remains unexpired at year end. Therefore, adjust 4000.
All adjustments change one Income Statement Account (revenue or expense) and one Balance Sheet Account (asset on credit, liability).

Income Summary: the merging of expenses and revenues into retained earnings, and removing dividend account.

Accumulated Depreciation is always LESS the asset itself in the asset section!

MERCHANDISER ACCOUNTING
Merchandising is buying inventory intended for sale.
There are two merchandisers: wholesalers and retailers. The operating cycle is A. Purchases B. Merchandise Inventory C. Credit Sales D. Accounts Receivable E. Cash Collection.

Cost of Goods Sold appears on the INCOME statement; often largest deduction from net sales. The result is Gross Profit. Minus expenses would be Net Income.

Beginning Inventory + Net Purchases = Cost of Goods Sold + Ending Inventory.

Perpetual Inventory System: updated after each purchase.
Periodic Inventory System: reported after a period.

Invoice: follows a credit payment and outlines the seller, invoice date, purchaser, order date, credit terms (upcoming payments and their dates), freight terms, goods, total invoice amount, and net amount. n/30 = net 30 days.

Discounts can be applied to incentivize earlier payment: 2/10, n/30 (Deduct 2% of invoice if made within first 10 days of invoice date).

Title Transfers:
FOB Shipping Point: buyer owns goods in transit. Dr. Merch Inventory Cr. Cash.
FOB Destination: seller owns goods in transit. Dr. Delivery Expense Cr. Cash.

Itemized Costs of Purchases:
invoice cost of merch LESS discounts, returns, and allowances ADD cost of transportation.

Each sale of merch as two parts:

Revenue recorded and asset increased from customer.
Cost of goods sold incurred and asset decreased to the customer.
Dr. Cost of Goods Sold Cr. Merchandise Inventory

Shrinkage:
A cost in an of itself; Dr. Cost of Goods Cr. Merchandise Inventory

Merchandisers TEMP Accounts to Close:
Sales; Sales Discounts; Sales Returns and Allowances; Cost of Goods Sold

Closing:
Sales Dr.
Income Summary Cr.

Expenses and Sales stuff (discounts, returns and allowances, cost of goods sold): Dr. Income Summary Cr. Expenses sales stuff

Multi-Step Income Statement:
for merchandisers:
it has the Gross Profit (sales, LESS sales discounts, sales returns and allowances, minus cost of goods sold), the Income from Expenses section, and Net Income section.

Selling Expenses: costs to market

General and Admin Expenses: costs to keep business running

Single-Step Income Statement:
Groups Revenues like sales, revenues, gain on sales; and Expenses, such as Costs of Goods Sold, Selling Expenses, General Administration Expenses etc.
The difference is Net Income.

Single-Step doesn't discriminate relation between Selling and Administrative.

Inventory is LESS Liquid than Accounts Receivable.

Acid-Test Ratio: tests ability to pay back debts but concerns Quick Assets (more Liquid) over Current Liabilities,.

Quick Assets: Cash and Cash Equivalents + Short Term Investments + Current Receivables < 1.10 shows Liabilities exceed Quick Assets. Near to 1.0 is best.

<mark class="formula">Gross Margin Ratio = Net Sales - Cost of Goods Cold / Net Sales</mark>

22842 | 23822 | 23241.60 | 23572

COST ACCOUNTING
Weighted Average:
average cost of inventory at end of period.
Cost of Goods Available for Sale / Units Available for Sale

Costs assigned to End of Year Inventory using one of 4 costing methods: FIFO, LIFO,
Weighted Average or Specific Identification.

Inventory is recorded at the market value of Replacing Inventory when Net Market Value is lower than Cost. Inventory is recorded at the Balance Sheet at the LOWER of Cost or Market value (LCM).

Market Value is replacement cost for LIFO, but Net Realizable Value for other methods. When Market Value is lower than Cost of Inventory, a Loss is recorded.

Total Cost ||| Total Market ||| LCM Applied to Items

Market Adjust: Cr. Merchandise Inventory Account Dr. Cost of Goods Sold

Inventory Errors:
Item missed or counted twice; purchase discount overlooked:

NET INCOME = Beginning Inventory + Net Purchases - Ending Inventory = Cost of Goods Sold

An error in Inventory is said to be Self Correcting as long as Year 3 is Inventoried Properly. Year 1 Ending inventory becomes Year 2 Beginning Inventory; Year 1 Cost and Year 2 Cost is affected.

<mark class="formula">Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / AVG Inventory</mark>
This Ratio shows Management Control of Inventory.

<mark class="formula">Days' Sales in Inventory = (Ending Inventory / Cost of Goods Sold) * 365</mark>

IMPORTANT: assigning costs per unit of inventory. Each of 4 methods depends on type of product and storage. Assuming same item sold att differentt points in May: Sales at differnetn costs are accounted for by chosen method. FIFO LIFO WA SI

FIFO: costs flow in order incurred.
"We want to sell milk in a FIFO basis. The first item sold is the first that arrived." Put the older milk first; regardless if customer finds newer milk gallon.

LIFO: costs flow in reverse order incurred
"Hard candy put in big barrel, doesn't matter when purchased. It must be kept full. It's a business choice."

WA (Weighted Average): Costs flow at an average of costs available.
"Gasoline sold from station from underground tank."
Cost of Goods Available / Units Available for Sale

SI (Specific Identification): requires records of all specific costs of items sold.
Ending inventory is also segregated by specific cost.
2045 + 2685 costs

Weighted Average is calculated as purchases happen in a perpetual system.

100$ for first remainder; CARRIES OVER

5 @ 100
35 @ 114

Costs of Goods Sold = Expense DrEAD

---------- HW

Merchandise Inventory = (Storage, Selling, Insurance, and Invoice Costs).

Perishables have an Actual Physical Flow of FIFO????? duh.

FIFO would typically report highest gross profit and net income Because COGS is lowest!

13.5 * 14
180 + 189 / 24
369/24

Net Income Lower? COGS higher!

48 + 120 + 36

In a declining cost market, LIFO would have highest taxes and highest ending inventory

Internal Control System:
Policy and Procedure for:
Protecting Assets, Ensuring Reliable Accounting, Promoting Efficient Operations, and Upholding Company Policies

Sarbanes-Oxley Act:
Requires managers and auditors to document and verify internal controls.

The company must have effective internal controls
Auditors must evaluate internal controls
Auditors' work is overseen by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)
-Violators receive harsh penalties, up to 25 years in pRiSoN with fines.
Principles of Internal Control (7):

Establish Responsibilities: who can be held accountable? separate registers, for instance.
Maintain Adequate Records: numbering and paper trails for accountability
Insure Assets and Bond Key Employees: insured against loses and employees are "bonded" so that people don't steal assets
Separate Record-keeping from Custody of Assets: a person who controls or has access to an asset must not keep the accounting records.
Divide Responsibility for Related Transactions: separate duties such that one employee can check/balance another.
Apply Technological Controls: apps, registers, locks, electronic files, time-clocks, scanners (access control, badging, fingerprinting etc.
Perform Regular and Independent Reviews: done by internal or external (3rd party) auditors not directly involved with the business activities; they assess effectiveness of internal control systems.
Technology on Internal Controls:

Reduce processing errors
Less human involvement could lead to software or automated issues going unnoticed.
More extensive testing of records
Separation of duties (the programmer shouldn't operate it)
New Evidence of Processing: can record additional transaction details. Tech focuses more on control and not on analysis.
Increased E-Commerce (issues such as credit card theft, identity theft, viruses could emerge)
Blockchain Ledger: new, more secure type of accounting ledger that is simultaneously updated and verify; nothing is destroyed or hidden.
Limitations of Internal Control:

Human Error or Fraud:
Fraud Triangle: Opportunity, Pressure/Incentive, Rationalization/Attitude
Cost-Benefit Constraint: costs of internal controls must not exceed their benefits. Must consider all factors, including not to affect morale. They must be determined to have a net benefit to the company.
Cash

Most liquid of all assets, and most able to be hidden.
Guidelines for Controls over Cash:

Separate the handling of cash from the record-keeping of cash.
Promptly deposit cash receipts in a bank
Make cash payments by check (or electronic funds transfer [EFT])
Liquidity: Ability of a company's ability to pay for its current liabilities.
Liquid Assets are most quickly converted to cash or can more easily offset liabilities. They are listed first on the balance sheet's asset section.

Criteria for Cash Equivalents:

Readily convertible to a known cash amount. NOT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TYPICALLY
Close enough to their due date so that their market value will not greatly change. USUALLY WITHIN 3 MONTHS OF DUE DATE.
Cash Management:

Plan cash receipts to meet cash payments when due.
Keep a minimum amount of cash to operate.
Cash Management Strategies:
-Encourage collection of receivables

Delay payment of liabilities
Keep only necessary levels of assets
Plan expenditures
Invest excess cash (cash from seasonal cycles could be invested in short term growth accounts).
Cash Receipts:

Registers have locked-in permanent records. The operator should not have access to this. Supervisor sends this to Company Cashier. The record is the basis for a journal entry. The clerk and cashier have access to cash but not accounting records. The accountant has access to the records, but not the actual cash.
Clerk -> Cash & Cash Receipt from Register (records amount and turns in record to Company Cashier)
Company Cashier -> Receives Cash Receipt and Register Receipt (Has access to Cash but no access to permanent record); Prepares Journal Entry.
Supervisor -> Reads Register Data, prepares Register Sheet; Compares to Cash Receipt (sends both to Company Cashier. Doesn't handle Cash)

Cash Over and Short Account:

Cr. Cash Over and Short for excess Cash
Dr. Cash Over and Short for missing Cash
Sales appears at bottom as Cr. ; Cash Dr.
Excess could be Misc. Revenues; Missing could be Misc. Expenses.
Cash Receipts by Mail:

best done with 2 or more employees
List of Money Received: sender names, amount, why sent.
Copies:
Sent with money to Cashier
Sent to Record-Keeper in the Accounting Area
Kept by Clerk who opened Mail
Control of Cash Payments:

Most large thefts is from FAKE INVOICES.
Good Practice: require all payments by Check.
Small Businesses could have just the owner sign Checks.
Large Businesses must rely on Internal Controls
Voucher System establishes Procedures for:

Verifying, approving, and recording liabilities for cash payments
Issuing checks for payment of verified, approved, and recorded liabilities.
LIABILITIES MUST BE VERIFIED before paying them off, basically!
Separate Departments collaborate in verification (e.g. Accounting, Receiving, Purchasing, Requesting)
There are Documents created for these actions: Purchase Requisition, Invoice, Check etc.
Petty Cash Control:

to avoid writing checks for small amounts (fees, low-cost supplies) for a week/month
Petty Cash Account
The fund can be reimbursed after the petty expenses (MISC EXPENSES) are Dr. and the Petty Cash?? Account is Cr.
Increasing the Fund means to Dr. Petty Cash & Cr. Cash.
Should be notated in comments.
Cash Over and Short Account is used to notate errors during managing Petty Cash
TRANSPORTATION-IN IS MERCHANDISE INVENTORY
Petty Cash account does not change; it equals the fund balance, always, unless fund is increased or decreased.
Bank Account:
Record setup by Bank for Customer.
Signature Card: Debit Card.

Bank Statement:
typically sent to depositor once a month. Shows accounts balances.

Bank Reconciliation:
Verifies accuracy of both bank statement and cash accounts of business. This can happen due to out-of-sync events and transactions.
Common Causes:

Outstanding Checks
Deposits in Transit
Bank Fees and NSF (non-sufficient funds) Checks
Additions for Collection of Notes (memo sent)
Bank Error or Depositor Error
Bank Balance... # | Book Balance... #
Add & Deduct:

Timing Differences
Any Errors
Adjusted Bank Bal... #
Preparing Bank Reconciliation:

Enter bank balance taken from the bank statement
Add unrecorded deposits (Deposit in transit) and bank errors understating the bank balance
Subtract any Outstanding Checks (coming out of account) and bank errors overstating the bank balance from the bank balance
Compute the adjusted bank balance
Enter cash account book balance taken from the accounting records
Add any unrecorded cash receipts (like interest) and errors understating the book balance to the book balance
Subtract any unrecorded bank fees, NSF checks, and errors overstating the book balance and deduct them from the book balance.
Compute adjusted book balance.
IF 4 & 8 are equal, then it's RECONCILED.

Record Collection of Credit Sales: Dr. Cash Asset Cr. Receivable
Credit Card Sales:

charge Fee to seller
is journaled as Credit Card Expense Dr.
Bad Debts:

Dr. Bad Debts Expense Cr. Receivable
TO RECOVER: Cr. Bad Debts, Dr. Receivable; Cr. Receivable Dr. Cash
ONLY RECOVER WHAT IS PAID

Does not best match sales and expenses.
Permitted when bad debts are immaterial
Materiality Constraint permits use of Direct Write-Off Method
GAAP-approved if results approximate the Allowance Method
Allowance Method:

Matches estimated loss to Sales produced
Two Advantages:

Reports accounts receivable at estimated amount to be collected.
BAD DEBTS EXPENSE on Income Statement.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a Contra-Asset Account

Less: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ... $
Estimating Bad Debts:
Percent of Sales Method: based on the income statement relation between bad debts and sales; the "Income Statement Method"
Accounts Receivable Method:

Percent of Accounts Receivable: A/R x % = Est.
Adjusts the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Balance Reported
EQUAL to the ESTIMATE of Uncollectible A/R

Aging of Accounts Receivable

Receivables are classified by how long they are past due date
The longer an amount is past due, the less likely it is to be collected
Aged amounts are used to estimate the percent of each uncollectible class
DAYS PAST DUE are assigned a PERCENTAGE on a Schedule of Accounts Receivable

Accounts Receivable Turnover:
Measures how often receivables are collected.
Net Sales / AVG A/R, net.

High Turnover: could be laxer to increase sales.
Low Turnover: should be stricter with credit terms to keep money out of receivables

Appraised Value

Apportioned Cost: Find Total appraised value of assets, then determine percentage of total each asset is based on appraised value total.

Then, multiply the purchase cost by that percentage to find Apportioned Cost which should add up to Lump Sum Price.

Paid 90000 Lump;
Land appraised @ 30000
Improvements appraised @ 10000
Building appraised @ 60000
Appraised Total = 100000

<mark class="formula">Straight-Line Depreciation = Cost - Salvage Value / Useful Life in Periods</mark>
Charges same amount of depreciation over the course of an asset's useful life.

10000 - 1000 / 5 years = 1800 per year.

Units-of-Production Method:
Used when certain periods have productive times and unused times.
<mark class="formula"> Depreciation Per Unit = Cost - Salvage (Depreciable Cost) / TOTAL Units of Production</mark>

Depreciation per unit is reported and the cost of producing each unit is multiplied.

30000 value
60000units is useful life.
30000 / 60000 = .5 per unit
23000units in 2022 = 11500

It's an Accelerated Depreciation Method.

<mark class="formula">Depreciation Expense = Double-Declining Rate * Beginning-Period Book Value</mark>

33000cost - 3000salvage / 3 useful years = 10000 per year (33.3%) * 2 = 66.6% = 20000

66.6% OF WHAT??? Not 30000 apparently.
Began period with 33000 yes? 22000 then, I'm going with that.

Can't go Below Salvage! Last Year would be the difference between last balance and salvage.

MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System):
US Federal Income Tax Law requires Straight-Line depreciation for some assets and Accelerated depreciation for most others. MACRS is not acceptable for financial reporting because it does not consider useful life or salvage value.

Changes is Estimates:
We can revise salvage value, useful life, and depreciation, but must use current period's data. The current depreciated book value less revised salvage value over revised useful life.

4yr useful life. 12000original, 2000salvage.
yr1=10000
yr2=8000
yr3=6000
6000 current book value - 1200 new salvage value = 4800 depreciable cost
6yr useful life, so 2 years now remain.

4800/2 = 2400 OOOH THREE YEARS REMAIN; 3/6 WERE USED, NOT 4.
= 1600

Capital Expenditures provide benefits beyond current period; Revenue expenditures are essentially upkeep expenses.
Betterments: significant replacements that extend useful lives that benefit future periods, like engines and control systems.
Extraordinary Repairs are similar.

Disposal: Discard; Sale; Exchange

Record depreciation up to the date of disposal.
Record the removal of the disposed asset's account balances
Record any cash (and/or other assets) received or paid in the disposal.
Record any gain or loss.

Known Liabilities:

measurable obligations arising from agreements, contracts, or laws.
Payroll Liabilities:

salaries, wages, benefits, payroll taxes
FICA: Federal Insurance Contributions Act

Social Security taxes (for incomes under $137700)
Medicare taxes
FPL: Federal Poverty Level

$15060 for a single person.
Medicaid covers individuals in participating states under 138% of FPL following the Affordable Care Act of 2010
Employers must pay FICA taxes on payroll.
Self-employed must pay both employee and employer FICA taxes.

Employers must pay FUTA: Federal Unemployment Tax Act taxes on wages and salaries total earned under $7000.
This can be reduced by paying SUTA: State unemployment Tax Act taxes for the state's own unemployment fund. The rate paid is adjusted based on the employer's Merit Rating based on stability in employing workers.

Internal Controls of Payroll:

Employee Hiring
Payroll Preparation
Timekeeping
Payroll Payment
Multiperiod Known Liabilities:

3YR Subscription would be debited as Unearned Revenue in later periods, but seen as a Current Portion of Long-Term Debt for current period.
"8.5% of fraud connected to payroll; $72000 median loss per fraud; 24months median time to uncover"

RECORDED WHEN IT WAS EARNED, even though it would be PAYED next year!
EXPENSE RECOGNITION PRINCIPLE!

Contingent Liability:

potential obligation that depends on a future event arising from a past transaction or event: pending lawsuit
Conditions:

Record Liability: the future event is probable and the amount owed can be reasonably estimated: warranties, vacation pay, income taxes
Disclose in Notes: the future event is reasonably possible.
No Disclosure: the future event is remote and unlikely.
Applied to: potential legal claims, debt guarantees (like an athlete ending service due to injury), and other contingencies (environmental damages, taxes assessments, insurance losses, and government investigations)

Uncertainties Non-Contingent: random natural disasters, conflicts, new technologies did not arise from past transactions, so they are not disclosed.

Times Interest Earned Ratio:

A measure of ability to pay liabilities, especially fixed ones (like interest) with variable income and expenses.

<mark class="formula">Times Interest Earned = Income Before Interest Expense and Income Taxes / Interest Expense</mark>

if Times Interest Earned falls below around 1.5, a business will likely be at risk of not being able to pay its liabilities.

Corporation: separate from its owners with many same legal rights as a person.

Advantages:

Separate Legal Entity
Limited LIability
Transferable Ownership Rights
Continuous Life
No Mutual Agency for Stockholders
Easier Capital Accumulation
Disadvantages:

Government Regulation
Corporate Taxation (& double taxation)
Charter: applied for by initial stockholders called promoters or incorporators, granted by a State Government!
Bylaws: guidelines that govern a corporation

Common Stock: stock when a corporation has one class of stock

Corporation Charter grants specific rights;
State Laws grant general rights.

Usual Rights:

voting at stockholder meetings
sell or dispose of stock
purchase proportional share to what's currently owned as a preemptive right.
Receive same dividend for common share
Registrar: keeps list of stockholders
Transfer Agent: assists with purchases and sales of shares

Organization Costs: costs to start a corporation including legal fees, promoter's fees, and payments for a charter. Dr. Organization Expenses

Stockholder meetings are held at least once a year typically, and a non-attendee can give voting rights to an agent by proxy, a document that gives agent right to vote.

Authorized Stock: number of shares a corporation's charter allows it to sell. Usually exceeds amount of shares issued by a large amount. Outstanding (Held) Stock: held by stockholders. No journal entry needed to authorize stock.

Selling (Issuing) Stock: direct sale is from corporation to buyer; indirect sale is through payment of a brokerage house (investment banker) to sell stock. Some Underwrite Stock: they buy and resell to investors.

Par Value Stock: amount assigned per share by charter. Can establish a Minimum Legal Capital, which is a minimum purchase of stock to minimize risk.

No-Par Value Stock: not assigned an amount per charter. Stated Value Stock is a No-Par Stock. All do not affect stock's market value.

Stockholder's Equity: "Paid-in-Capital" (contributed capital) is total amount received in exchange for stock AND retained earnings (cumulative net income and loss)

Cash Dividends: distributions of cash to stockholders. Payment is determined by directors. They may keep it to invest in growth, meet emergencies, or pay off debt.

Date of Declaration: when directors vote to pay a dividend.
Date of Record: date receiving stockholders are identified
Date of Payment: when corporation makes payment

Retained Earnings ...
... Common Dividend Payable ...

Common Dividend Payable ...
... Cash ...

Stock Dividends: distribution of additional shares of its stock to stockholders without payment in return. Stock Dividends do not reduce assets and equity, but instead transfer a portion of equity from Retained Earnings to Contributed Capital (capitalizing Retained Earnings). Accounting for Stock Dividends depend on whether large or small.

Small Stock Dividend: distribution of 25% or less of previously outstanding shares. Recorded by capitalizing Retained Earnings for an amount equal to the MARKET value of shares.
Large Stock Dividend: distribution of more than 25% of previously outstanding shares; recorded by capitalizing Retained Earnings for the Par or Stated value of stock.

Stock Split: No journal entry for splitting stock into multiple stocks. Cost per stock or par would decrease according to split. e.g. 10000 stock @ 20$ par becomes 20000 stock @ 10 par; stockholders retain equivalent.
Par Table: shows cost per stock and par value.

Preferred Stock: has special rights that give it priority over Common Stock in one or more areas. Preferred Stock is its own account, and is paid out earlier than Common Stock.

Cumulative Preferred Stock: grants right to be paid for current and prior periods' unpaid dividends before Common Stockholders. If unpaid dividend amount can't cover, or directors decide against payment, the dividend is called Dividend in Arrears. There is no guarantee of payment, and it is not a liability; only reported as a memo on Financial Statements.
Noncumulative Preferred Stock: only includes rights for current-period dividends.

Preferred Stock Reasons: raising capital without affording voting rights, expected returns on Common Stock seem low, and leverage.

Dividend Rate on Preferred Stock < Rate Corporation earns on Assets ? Issuing Preferred Stock increases rate earned by Common Stockholders

Frequency of Preferred Stock: None 73%, Issued 27%

Treasury Stock: "Stock Buyback;" A corporation buys its own stock, similar to Unissued Stock. For reasons below:

To use shares to buy another corp.
To avoid takeover of the company
To give them to employees as compensation.
To maintain a strong market for their stock or to show confidence in current price.

Statement of Retained Earnings: generally cumulative net income minus net losses and dividends declared. Retained Earnings do not imply a certain amount of cash or other assets available to pay stockholders.

Restrictions and Appropriations on Retained Earnings:
Statutory (legal) Restriction: is to limit Treasury Stock purchases to the amount of Retained Earnings.
Contractual Restriction: a loan agreement that restricts paying dividends beyond a specified amount of Retained Earnings.

Prior Period Adjustments: corrections of material errors in past financial statements: math errors, improper accounting, missed facts. Reported on STATEMENT of RETAINED EARNINGS, net of any income tax effects. For events prior to the earliest period reported in current set of financial statements.

Many items on Financial Statements are based on estimates. Inaccuracies in them are not errors to adjust, but rather estimates to adjust in current and future periods.

Statement of Stockholders' Equity: lists the beginning and ending balances of key equity accounts and described the changes that occur during that period.
| Common Stock | Paid-In Capital Excess of Par | Retained Earnings | Treasury Stock | Total Equity

---------- Formulas

Earnings Per Share (EPS): income earned per share of outstanding Common Stock

Basic EPS = Net Income - Preferred Dividends / Weighted-AVG Common Shares Outstanding

CUMULATIVE PREF.DIV Subtracted when Declared in same period

Price-Earnings (PE) Ratio: interpreted as what price the market is willing to pay for a company's current earnings stream. Higher means better expectations of future earnings. "For each ___ of stock, 1$ is earned"

OVERPRICED? ~ > 20
UNDERPRICED? ~ < 5 to 8
PE Ratio = Market Value per Share / Earnings per Share

Dividend Yield: rate of dividend payouts. Higher large dividend payouts are known as income stocks which deliver recurring cash flows.

Statement of Cash Flows: reports cash inflows (receipts) and outflows (payments). Separated into Operating, Investing, and Financing activities.

Operating Cash Flows
| Current Assets
| Current Liabilities

Investing Cash Flows
| Long-Term Assets

Financing Activities
| Long-Term Liabilities and Equity

Some Investing and Financing Activities don't affect Cash Flows e.g. purchase of long-term assets for long-term notes payable.

5-Steps of Cash Flow Statement

Compute net increase or decrease in cash
Compute net cash from or for operating activities
investing activities
financing activities
Compute net cash from all sources; then prove it by adding it to beginning cash to get ending cash
Second Approach (Non-Cash Analysis)

Cash = Liabilities + Equity - Non-cash Assets

Operating Cash Flows

Direct Method (1%)

separately lists operating cash receipts and payments; payments are subtracted from receipts.
Indirect Method (99%)
Reports net income and then adjusts it for items that do not affect cash. It does not report individual items of cash inflows and cash outflows from operating activities.
Investing Cash Flows

Three step analysis for changes in all long-term asset accounts and any current accounts for notes receivable and investments in securities.
Identify Changes in Investing-related Accounts
Determine the Cash Effects using T-accounts and Reconstructed Entries
Report the Cash Flow Effects
Financing Cash Flows

Identify changes in financing related accounts
determine the cash effects using T-accounts and reconstructed entries
report the cash flow effects.
Examples of Financing Activities: receiving cash from issuing debt or repaying amounts borrowed and receiving cash from or distributing cash to owners

<mark class="formula">Cash Flow on Total Assets =
Cash Flow from Operations / AVG total assets.</mark>
The ratio = actual cash flows; Helps estimate amount and timing of cash flows from operating activities.

---------- HW

Notes Receivable is Investing

Gain in Common Stock value is an increase to financing. Financing: long-term debt, notes payable, bonds payable, common stock, retained earnings; non-current liability accounts and equity.

Depreciation and Amortization are added back to Net Income for Cash Flow compilation.

LOGIC of Adjustments!

Current Assets like A/R are Deducted from Net Income when increased, and Added to Net Income when decreased.
Current Liabilities like Wages Payable are Added to Net Income when Increased and Deducted from Net Income when decreased.
Non-Cash Expenses or losses are Added to Net Income
Non-Cash Revenues and Gains are Deducted from Net Income

Financial Statement Analysis

Internal Users want to improve company efficiency and effectiveness. External users want information to make better and more informed decisions in pursuing their goals.

Building Blocks of Analysis:
1: Liquidity and Efficiency: can meet short-term obligations and efficiently generate revenue
2: Solvency: can meet long term obligations and generate future revenue
3: Profitability: can provide financial rewards sufficient to attract and retain financing
4: Market Prospects: can generate positive market expectations.

General Purpose Financial Statements:
Balance Sheets, Income Statements, Statement of Retained Earnings, Statement of Cash Flows, Notes to the Financial Statements

Good? Bad? Avg.? performance?
- Gotta use Standards for Comparisons:
1: Intracompany: prior performance and relations between financial items
2: Competitor: one or more direct competitors of the company
3: Industry: stats
4: Guidelines: general standards from past exp. & personal judgements

Tools of Financial Analysis:
1: Horizontal Analysis: measuring financial condition across time (years; dollar change; percent change)
2: Vertical Analysis: measuring in reference to a base-amount (common-size analysis; for individual financial statement items, or groups of items)
3: Ratio Analysis: measurement of key relationships among key financial items

<mark class="formula">Percent Change = (Analysis Period Amount - Base Period Amount / Base Period Amount) * 100</mark>

Trend Analysis: line graph typically; patterns across data periods! 
<mark class="formula">Trend Percent = (Analysis Period Amount / Base Period Amount) * 100</mark>

Common-Size Comparative Balance Sheets usually use a base-amount like Total Assets as 100%; and Income Statements would use Revenue as 100%

Common-Size Percent = (Analysis Amount / Base Amount) * 100

Common-Size Income Statement can be displayed easily with Pie Chart. Yes.

Managerial Accounting: to provide useful information to management and other internal decision makers. 

Planning! Control! Strategy!
Gathering information for cost and control decisions.

No GAAP rules for Managerial Accounting.

Financial Accounting focuses on the whole company's past performance; managerial accounting focuses on a company's projects, processes, and divisions' current performance and future projections.

Managerial Accounting isn't only Monetary; it deals with non-monetary data like satisfaction and delivery times.

Fraud Triangle:
- Opportunity, Pressure, Rationalization

IMA (Institute of Management Accountants) outlines ethics for Managerial Accounting

Costs:
- Direct: cost-effectively traced to a cost-object like a product and labor costs to assemble
- Indirect: cannot be; manager salaries, building rent, maintenance salaries, depreciation

Capitalized as Inventory
- Product Costs (activities around producing product) with Direct materials, Direct labor, Indirect manufacturing costs

Expensed as Incurred
- Period Costs (activities associated with time itself) as with Selling, General Administrative Expenses, expensed in Income Statement

Manufacturing Costs
- Direct Materials [Prime Cost]
- Direct Labor [Prime Cost] [Conversion Cost]
- Overheads [Conversion Cost] (cannot be traced to specific productive activity)

Lean Principles
- fulfill social responsibility, satisfying customers, elimination of waste. 
- TQM (Total Quality Management), Just-in-Time Production, Value Chain aid in application of Lean.
- Triple Bottom Line: a focus on financial, social, and environmental measures.

---------- HW

Product / Period
Direct / Indirect

Finished Goods Beginning + Cost of Goods Manu - Finished Goods Ending = Cost of Goods Sold

Utilities for a Factory Plant are Product Costs, not Period.

Cost of hourly workers doing carpet cleaning for such cleaning company would be direct and variable cost.
Cost of those machines' straight-line depreciation would be Indirect Overhead, because their degradation is not tied to specific cleaning jobs.

Work-in-Process Inv. is included in Cost of Goods Manufactured

Cost Accounting
1: Job-Order Costing
2: Process Costing

Job-Order Production or Manufacturing:
- custom things, like custom factory machines, factory building, custom jewelry, tattoos, audits from a firm etc.
- Specifically designed for a specific customer
- Volume of production is typically low
- More than 1? Considered a Job Lot.

Process Production:
- Repetitive procedures to make similar products and services, high production volume, high standardization and low product flexibility

Jobs are separated in Work-In-Process Inv., Finished Goods Inv. and Cost of Goods Sold

Accumulated Costs follow Job Orders

Subsidiary Records:
- for managers; includes Raw Materials, Overhead Costs, Jobs in Process, and Finished Goods info.

Job Cost Sheet
- a document for each Job. 
- Only product costs are on the sheet
- Estimated Overhead cost incurred on the job is included

Job Order Costing in Service Businesses
- must estimate number of staff hours needed
- overhead rate is established
- they must consider the market and create a quote

Materials Cost Flows and Documents:
- Receiving Report => Materials Ledger Cards (updated for material purchases and issues for production) => (Direct Materials to Materials Requisitions to Job Cost Sheets ; Indirect Materials to Materials Requisitions to Factory Overhead Ledger)

Journal Entries
Raw Materials Inventory ...
... Accounts Payable ...
Work In Process Inventory ...

Labor Cost Flows and Documents
- Time Tickets: time spent for a job flow to Direct Labor
- Salary Contracts: flow to Indirect Labor as Overhead

Journal Entries

... Factory Wages Payable ...

Set Predetermined Overhead Rate and Apply Estimated Overhead
- Managers must determine what estimated Overhead Cost would be for a period.

Activity (Allocation) Base:
- related to production, like direct labor or machine hours, related to Overhead cost.

Record Actual Overhead
- Indirect Materials through Materials Requisitions
- Indirect Labor through Time Tickets
- Vouchers (authorizing payments for supplies or utilities)
- Adjusting Entries (like depreciations)
--- All are recorded with debits to the Factory Overhead general ledger account

Total Manufacturing costs include:
- Direct Materials
- Direct Labor
- Factory Overhead APPLIED (not Actual)

Income Statement:
- Sales less Cost of Goods Sold for Gross Profit
- Selling Expenses, General Administrative Expenses

Balance Sheet:
- Reports Inventory Account balances from the Schedule of Cost of Goods Manufactured (Direct Materials, Direct Labor, Factory Overhead Applied, Total Manufacture Costs + Beginning Work in Process Inventory minus Ending Work in Process Inventory, Cost of Goods Manufactured)

Overhead Costs Applied to Different Jobs
- Overhead Incurred ≠ Overhead Applied
- Actual Overhead is known at the end of the period
- Applied Overhead is estimated during the period

- high level of standardization used to produce many things
- as opposed to Job Order Operations which is for custom things
- the processes are separate departments typically
- they extend to services as well
- tracks Direct Materials, Direct Materials, and Overhead
- measures unit costs at the end of a period
- the cost object is a process
- they use 1 Work In Process Inventory count per process

Step 1: Determine Physical Flow of Units
- Units to Account For => Units Accounted For

Step 2: Compute Equivalent Units of Products (EUP)
- EUP = whole units started and completed in the costs incurred in the period
- Exists because some units aren't completed by the end of the period but still need to be assigned costs

Activity-Based Costing
- where an activity, task, operation etc. is what would cause Overhead costs to be incurred.
- includes: production setups, machine usage, fabrication, design, assembly, inspection.
- Steps:  
1: Identify activities and assign budgeted costs to activity cost pools
2: Compute an overhead activity rate for each activity cost pool
3: Allocate overhead costs to cost objects

Activity Cost Driver: causes cost of an activity to go up or down.

| Activity | Budgeted Cost | Activity Cost Driver | Budgeted Activity Usage | 
(
| Production | $600000 | Direct Labor Hours | 100000 Direct Labor Hours
);

Computing Activity Rate: 
| Activity Cost Driver | Actual Activity Usage |

Dollar Sales at Target Income = Fixed Costs + Target Income / Contribution Margin Ratio

Unit Sales at Target Income = Fixed Costs + Target Income / Contribution Margin per Unit

Measuring Cost Behavior:

1. Scatter Diagram: graph of unit volume and cost data
2. High-Low Method
--- Step 1: Identify Highest and Lowest volume levels
--- Step 2: Compute the slope
--- Step 3: Compute the total fixed costs

Variable Cost per Units = Change In Cost / Change in Units

Total Cost = Fixed Cost + (Variable Cost per Units * Number of Units)

3. Regression (least squares regression):
- Through statistical methods Implemented in Spreadsheet 

Comparisons:
- High Low is useful for quick cost estimates; Regression is more accurate

Break Even Point:
- When Total Costs equal total Sales: 0 income.
- Applicable to all orgs and events
- Expressed in units or sales
- Can be determined by:
1.  Forumla Method
- BreakEven(units) = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin per Unit
- BreakEven(dollars) = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin Ratio

2. Contribution Margin Income Statement

3. Cost-Volume-Profit Chart

Sales Mix and BreakEven:

Weighted-AVG Contribution Margin per Unit = Contribution Margin per Unit for Each Product * Sales Mix Percent for Each product.
| Soft Hats => sell for $15, Var $5, 80%

Absorption Costing and Variable Costing
- The products absorb costs during creation process, to include Direct Materials, Direct Labor, Variable Overhead, and could absorb Fixed Overhead... BUT

- Because Fixed Overhead can remain, the volume of an order may generate profit. Fixed Overhead is treated as an Period Cost, not a Product Cost. 

- Under Absorption Costing, Fixed Overhead can be treated as a Product Cost for the Business, but under Variable Costing, it would be treated as a Period Expense (in period Income Statement)

- An Income Statement w/ Variable Costing is considered a Contribution Margin Income Statement: 
| Sales
| Variable Expenses
| Variable Cost of Goods Sold
| Variable Selling and Administrative Expenses
| Contribution Margin

- When # Units Produced differs from # Units Produced Sold: Inventory Levels Change; $ Amount of Finished Goods Inventory on the Balance Sheet will differ too. Absorption Costing includes Fixed Overhead inside Cost of Goods Sold ONLY for what was sold. Variable Costing won't include the Fixed Overhead as part of Finished Goods Inventory

$prod = 1000
#sold = 750
fOverhead = 30000
___ 30000/750 = 40 per unit
vProd = 25 *750 = 18750
vAdmin = (10 * 750) = 7500
fAdmin = 15000

Planning Production
- based on reliable sales forecasts

Absorption Costing can bloat Income when Units Produced are higher than Units Sold; this would drive down the Cost of Goods Sold; this is related to the Manger Incentive Problem, where finished goods inventory assets and higher income rationalize bonuses.

To Determine Selling Prices:
1. Determine Product Cost per Unit using Absorption Costing
2. Determine Target Markup on Product Cost per Unit
3. Add Target Markup on the Product Cost to find the Target Selling Price (% of Absorption Cost) 

Variable Cost is good for Special Orders;
Fixed Costs do not change in the Short Run;

<mark class="formula">CM = Sales - Variable Expenses</mark>

Budgetary Control
- Budgets are plans in dollars, usually for short-medium term goals.
- Steps:
1. Develop Budget
2. Compare Actual to Budget
3. Take Action
4. Set New Plans
- Benefits: 
1. Plan: focuses on future opportunities and threats
2. Control: requires management evaluate operations against some norm
3. Coordinate: helps achieve goals across departments
4. Communicate: communicates action plans to all employees
5. Motivate: motivates employees:
- Participatory, Attainable, Evaluation needed for positivity. 
- Could lead to understating sales budgets and overstating expense budgets to allow for cushion
- Could spur fraud or unethical behavior.
- Could spur spending of full amount to ensure future budgets aren't reduced.

Annual Budget: usually FY-based; separated into quarterly or monthly etc. Monthly or quarterly budgets can be rolled as time passes. 
Rolled Budgets: revises entire set of budgets as a quarterly budget elapses.	`

	Standard Cost
Costs to deliver products under normal circumstances.

When actual costs vary from standard costs, they are logged. Management focuses on main differences between actual and standard costs. 

Standards for Direct Labor: Time and Motion Studies

Standards for Direct Materials: Quantity, Grade, and Cost of Each Material Used

Standards for Overhead: to support production activities

Standards are challenging but attainable and acknowledge machine breakdowns.

Sales Variances: 

Fixed and Flexible Budgets: options for preparing a Master Budget.

Cost Variance: Favorable (F) or Unfavorable (U). 

Flow of Events in Variance Analysis:
- Prepare Reports
- Analyze Variances
- Questions and Answers
- Take Action

Cost Variance (CV) Analysis:
Actual Cost (AC) is Actual Quantity (AQ) * Actual Price (AP) and Standard Cost (SC) is Standard Quantity (SQ) * Standard Price (SP)

Factors that Cause a Cost Variance
1. Price or rate variance. Difference between SP and AP
2. Quantity or usage or efficiency variance. Difference between SQ and AQ

<mark class="formula">Price Variance (PV) = (Actual Price (AP) - Standard Price (SP) * Actual Quantity (AQ))</mark>

<mark class="formula">Quantity Variance (QV) = (Actual Quantity (AQ) - Standard Quantity(SQ)) * Standard Price (SP)</mark>

Purchasing Department: responsible for quantity and quality of materials obtained.
Production Department: responsible for quantity of materials used and direct labor cost.

<mark class="formula">Standard Overhead Applied = Actual Production * Standard Amount of Allocation Base * Standard Overhead Rate</mark>

	Capital Investment

Break-Even Time: when present value of net cash flows = initial investment

Capital Budgeting Process
- Submit Proposal, Evaluate Proposal, Approve or Reject
- Risky:
1. outcome uncertain
2. large amounts of money involved
3. long-term commitment
4. difficult or impossible to reverse
- to return satisfactory ROI

Acquire: - initial investmnet
Use: + sales - expenses
Dispose: + salvage value

Payback Period Method
- shorter payback periods are preferred to increase return and reduce risk
- shouldn't be the only consideration: ignores the time-value of money, ignores cash flows after payback period, may have no cash inflow after period

<mark class="formula">Accounting Rate of Return = Annual Income / Average Investment</mark>

<mark class="formula">Average Investment = Initial Investment + Salvage Value / 2</mark>

<mark class="formula">Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Net Cash Flow</mark>

Accounting Rate of Return Method:
- simple computation
- consider weaknesses:
ignores time-value of money, does not directly consider cash flows and their timing

Net Present Value Analysis
- maps time-value of money to future cash inflows and cash outflows
<mark class="formula">NPV = Discounted Future Net Cash Flows - Initial Amount Invested (NPV > 0 ? Invest : Do Not Invest)</mark>

Required Rate of Return (Hurdle Rate): typically its cost of capital which must be paid.

Salvage Value: an additional cash inflow to expect

Profitability Index: used to compare investment projects

<mark class="formula">Profitability Index = Present Value of Net Cash Flows / Initial Investment</mark>

- use when amounts invested differ substantially
- higher profitability index suggests a more desirable project
- eliminate investments with profitability index < 1
- accept all positive NPV projects if possible

Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- Machine: init $41000, useful life 5yr, net cash flow $10000yr
- 2-steps with even cash flows:
1. Compute Present Value Factor:
41000/10000 = 4.1
2. Locate Present Value Factor in PV of Annuity Table closest.

If IRR - Hurdle Rate ≥ 0%, invest.

Environment and Theoretical Structure<br>

Assets: something with probably future economic benefit.<br>

Assets = Liability + Equity, of course.<br>

A firm can be perceived as a collection of assets.<br>

Liability: probable future sacrifice of economic benefit ie. Debt, Salaries, Taxes, Accounts<br>

Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX): (Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002): Created PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) to regulate auditors and the types of non-audit services they furnish to clients and requires rotation of the lead partner on an audit every 5 years. Provides: accountability for corporate execs, addresses conflicts of interest for securities analysts, and criminal penalties for violators.

Section 404: controversial: requires management to document internal controls and report on adequacy. Auditors must express an opinion on whether effective control over financial reporting is being done.

The Conceptual Framework: "Accounting Constitution": doesn't prescribe GAAP, but is a framework of interrelated objectives. Prescribes nature, function, and limits of accounting and reporting. 

FASB shows framework through SFAC's (Statements of Financial Accounting Concepts). SFAC(1) through (8).

SFAC(8): objective, qualitative chars
SFAC(7): cash flows, PV in making measurements
SFAC(6): 10 elements; accrual acc concepts in statements
SFAC(5): recognition

The Objective: to provide financial information to external entities that is useful.

Investors & Creditors: interested in amount, timing, and uncertainty of future cash flows

Qualitative Chars
Decision Usefulness = [Relevance = [Predictive Value, Confirmatory Value, Materiality], Faithful Representation = [Completeness, Neutrality, Free from Error]]

Assumptions:
- Economic Entity (about only entity)
- Going Concern (business will continue)
- Periodicity (timeliness)
- Monetary Unit (currency assumed stable)

Parent and Subsidiaries are ONE accounting entity but SEPARATE legal entities.

General Recognition Criteria [SFAC(5)]:
1. Definition: item meets definition of element in financial statements
2. Measurability: has relevant attribute that is measurable with reliability
3. Relevance: can make difference in decision making
4. Reliability: info is faithful, verifiable, and neutral

Measurement Attributes [SFAC(5)]:
1. Historical Cost: original transaction value
2. Net Realizable Value: estimated selling price in ordinary course of business less reasonably predicable costs
3. Current Cost: cost incurred to purchase or reproduce the asset
4. Present (or Discounted) value of Future Cash Flows: uses future cash flows as the basis for accounting measurement
5. Fair Value: price that would be paid or received at measurement date

Disclosure: including pertinent information in Financial Statements and Accompanying Notes. It is INTEGRAL to financial statements.

Full Disclosure Principle: reports should include any information that could affect external decision making, as long as cost of preparation does not exceed usefulness

Methods to Disclose Information:
1. Parenthetical Comments or Modifying Comments: placed on the face of the financial statements
2. Disclosure Notes: conveying additional insights about operations, agreements, litigation, accounting principles at play etc.
3. Supplemental Schedules and Tables: reports more details than shown in primary Financial Statements

IASC 1973 International Accounting Standards Committee became IASC 2001 International Accounting Standards Board

IASB Objective: develop single set of high-quality, understandable, enforceable global accounting standards.

IASB Standards are IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards).

Should US adopt IFRS?
- a single set would improve comparability of reporting and facilitate access to global capital.
BUT
- US standards should remain customized to fit legal and regulatory requirements of US environment
- Differences in implementation and enforcement may make IFRS accounting appear more uniform than it actually is
- Competition between multiple standard-setting regimes is healthy and could improve standards overall
- Political pressures on the IASB's process are severe 

IFRS Conceptual Framework
- provides explicit definitions of concepts like materiality, reporting entity, and executory contracts. DOES NOT take guidance from elsewhere like GAAP, such as ASC
- includes explicit criteria for DE-RECOGNITION of assets and liabilities ie. DOES NOT consider PROBABILITY of cash inflows and outflows.

// ---------- Hw ---------- //

Cash-Basis Accounting: expenses are registered for the periods paid. Focuses on cash inflows and outflows.

Accrual Accounting: expenses are registered for the periods applied

Standards for Transaction Logging:

Principles-Based: following a rigid set of rules; was skirted at Enron.

Objectives-Oriented: emphasizes using professional judgement. This model was chosen following the SEC's study in July 2003 following the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Balance Sheet: Snapshot @ End of Period

Liquidity: ability to convert assets to cash to pay current liabilities

Long-Term Solvency: Ability to pay ALL liabilities

Risk increases as liabilities increase

Solvency => Financial Flexibility: ability to alter cash flows in order to take advantage of unexpected opportunities and needs.

More Financial Responsibility, Less Risk of Failure (JUST LIKE IN ONE'S LIFE)

Limitations of Balance Sheet:
1. Company's Book Value: is Assets - Liabilities: does not represent the Market Value (price at which it could be sold @ market)
2. Valuable Resources can have ZERO value like trained employees, experienced management, loyal customer relationships, product knowledge etc.
3. Many items are reliant on Estimates

Market Value = Trading price of a share of corporation's stock

<mark class="formula">Overall Market Value = Share Price * Number of Shares Outstanding</mark>

Book Value ≠ Market Value
- Many assets are measured at their historical costs
- Many aspects of a company represent valuable resources but are not recorded as assets in balance sheet.

Current Assets:
- Cash & Equivalents
- Short-Term Investments
- Accounts Receivable (net)
- Inventories
- Prepaid Expenses

Long-Term Assets:
- Investments (not used in operations)
- Property, Plant, & Equipment: tangible 
- Intangible: patents, copyrights, franchises, trademarks
- Goodwill: arises during company purchase (Goodwill = Acquisition Price - Fair Value)
- Other Long-Term Assets: two common types: 1. Long-Term Operating Leases, 2. Long-Term Prepaid Expenses 

Current Liabilities: obligations due in the next year or operating cycle
- Accounts Payable
- Notes Payable
- Unearned Revenues
- Accrued Liabilities (salaries owed @ FY end, Interest Payable, Utilities Payable, Legal Fees Payable)

Long-Term Liabilities: obligations in farther future. Beyond 12months, like 2 years.
- Reported as notes in financial statements

Equities: residual interest in assets
- Total Equity = Shareholder's Equity
- Paid-In Capital
- Retained Earnings
- AOCI (Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income): Not reported in Income Statement!

Disclosure Notes: End of FY: Further discussion and calculations.
- allowance for uncollectible accounts
- information about common stock
- pension plans
- leases
- long-term debt
- investments
- income taxes
- property, plant, & equipment
- employee benefit plans
- related party transactions
- errors, fraud, illegal acts

After FY End but BEFORE Statements: Subsequent Event Disclosure Note.

Management's Discussion and Analysis: 
Their views on:
- significant events
- trends
- Uncertainties: 1. Results of Operations 2. Liquidity 3. Capital Resources 4. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  5. Critical Accounting Estimates

Prepares and is responsible for annual report:
- Asserts responsibility of management for information contained in annual report
- assessment of company's internal controls

SARBANES-OXLEY ACT: C-Suite Execs must personally certify the financial statements!
- false statements are punishable up to 20 years in prison

Proxy Statement to Shareholders
- provides compensation information for directors and top executives
- invites shareholders to the annual meeting to: elect board members & vote on issues before the shareholders

Auditor's Report
Auditors: examine financial statements and internal control procedures => Attest to fairness of company's financial statements => results in opinion stated in auditor's report

Types of Auditor's Reports
1. Unqualified
2. Unqualified with an explanatory or emphasis paragraph (Financial Statements are in conformity with GAAP; Auditor feels that other important information needs to be emphasized)
3. Qualified
4. Adverse or Disclaimer

Unqualified:
- Financial Information conforms with GAAP

Unqualified w/ Explanatory:
- Lack of Consistency
- Going Concern
- Material Misstatement in previously issued financial statements has been corrected

Unqualified w/ Emphasis of Matter:
- significant transactions with related parties
- important events subsequent to the balance sheet date, uncertainty relating to the future outcome of significant litigation or regulatory actions

Qualified:
- audit process has been limited
- there has been a departure from GAAP
- NEITHER is of sufficient seriousness to invalidate the financial statements as a whole.

Adverse Opinion:
- Specific Knowledge that Financial Statements or disclosures are seriously MISSTATED or MISLEADING
- Rare, because auditors usually are able to persuade management to rectify the problems

Disclaimer: auditor is not able to gather sufficient information that financial statements are in conformity with GAAP

Risk Analysis
- users are most interested in info about future
- Default Risk: risk that company couldn't pay due obligations
- Operational Risk: how company can withstand events that impair earning potential

Methods of Analyzing:
- Comparative Financial Statements: current statement & corresponding statement of preceding year
- Horizontal Analysis: each item in a statement is expressed as a percentage of that same item of another year's statement
- Vertical Analysis: each item is a percentage of a total or base amount in the same year
- Ratio Analysis: financial statement items are converted to ratios for evaluating performance and risk of a company

Liquidity Ratio
<mark class="formula">Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities</mark>

Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
Acid-Test (Quick) Ratio: excludes:
- Inventories
- Prepaid Items
- Restricted Cash
- Deferred Taxes

Acid-Test Ratio = (Unrestricted Cash + Short-Term Investments + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities
REMOVES LESS LIQUID ASSETS FROM CALC

Solvency Ratio
<mark class="formula">Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Shareholder's Equity</mark>
- Suggests company might be underutilizing debt

Times-Interest-Earned Ratio = Income before Interest & Taxes / Interest Expense

Balance Sheet Presentation
IFRS: minimum list of items; GAAP: none
IFRS: "statement of financial position"; GAAP: none
IFRS: Most often report non-current items first; GAAP: current assets and liabilities before non-current assets and liabilities

Key Concern: "short productive lives"

ASC 905-330-25-3: Animals with short productive lives, such as poultry, may be classified as inventory. Due to the short productive life of poultry, the cost of flocks may be classified as inventory. The accounting principles for poultry operations are much the same as those for other production animals (see paragraph 905-360-25-4), although the operating cycles are much shorter.

ASC 905-360-25-4: Except for animals with short productive lives classified as inventory under paragraph 905-330-25-3all of the following shall be recognized as fixed assets: a. Breeding animals, b. All livestock (which includes cattle, hogs, sheep, and goats), c. Production animals

Revenue Recognition: recognized when goods or services are transferred to customers. It is a transfer of control following contract.

Control: the customer is more likely to control a good or service if the customer has:
- An obligation to pay the seller
- legal title to the asset
- physical possession of the asset
- assumed risks and rewards of ownership
- accepted the asset

Performance Obligation: when the goods and services are distinct; makes sense to consider it separate from others. QA Warrantees and Registration Fees are not obligations. An Extended Warrantee is priced and sold separately and considered distinct; a separate sales transaction and thus performance obligation. Performance obligations provide a customer right that they would not have received otherwise. 

Contract Option & Transaction Price: if a contract includes an option that provides a material right, the seller must allocate part of the contract's transaction price to the option. The stand-alone price of the option must be estimated, and the likelihood of the customer realizing the option. Discount with coupon creates a performance obligation and its takers to non-takers ratio should be taken. 

ASC 606-10-05-4
Core Principle + 5 Steps to Apply
1. Identify the contract with a customer
2. Identify the performance obligation in contract
3. Determine the transaction price
4. Allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation
5. Recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied

Transaction Price is the entitlement to receive revenue.
Stand-Alone Price is the price under similar circumstances elsewhere.

Separating Promises: financial statements better reflect timing of transfer, and those than can be viewed on a stand-alone basis should be separated.

Prepayment: included in transaction price, allocated to the various performance obligations, initially recorded as deferred revenue, and recognized as revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.

Cash and Receivables

Internal Control:

A: encourage adherence to policy
B: promote operational efficiency
C: Minimize errors and theft
D: Enhance the reliability and accuracy of accounting data

COSO: Committee of Sponsoring Organizations => dedicated to improving quality of financial reporting and provides a framework for designing an internal control system
=> Defines Internal Control as:
- Effectiveness and efficiency of operations
- Reliability of financial reporting
- Compliance with applicable laws and regulations
// done by board of directors, management, and other personnel

Cash: most liquid of all assets

Separation of Duties: individuals that have physical responsibility for assets should not have access to accounting records and they should also not be those who reconcile cash and bank balances

Cash Disbursements:
- Disbursements should be made by check
- All expenditures should be authorized before a check is prepared
- ledger accounts being debited should be verified 
- checks should be signed only by authorized individuals

Separation of Duties in Cash Disbursements:
Check writing, check signing, check mailing, disbursement documenting, and record keeping should all be segregated.

Restrictions on Cash
Cash available for current operations or to satisfy current liabilities = Current Asset
Cash that is restricted and not available for current use = Non-Current Asset (usually)

Informal Restrictions: based on management's intent and classify as non-current assets.
Formal Restrictions: contractually imposed and classification depends: if debt is current, restricted cash is current; if debt is non-current, restricted cash is non-current.

Disclosure Notes: include:
- Any material restrictions of cash
- amounts and line items where they appear in the balance sheet

Lines of Credit (loans/ loan commitments) frequently require cash restrictions
=> borrower is asked to maintain a specified balance in an account known as a Compensating Balance

Compensating Balances: if the restriction is legally binding, it may be either current or non-current; if the restriction is informal, it may be reported as part of current assets

Accounting for Cash Discounts
Two Common Types:
1. Trade Discounts (not variable consideration/ not dependent on outcome)
2. Sales (Cash) Discounts (reductions in amount collect if customer pays within a specified period of time)

Sales Discount provides incentive for quick payment.

<mark class="formula">2/10 / n/30 = 2% within 10 days, otherwise pay within 30 days at normal price</mark>

Methods for Sales Discounts
Gross Method: seller initially records revenue and related receivable at full agreed-upon price.
Net Method: seller initially records revenue and related receivable at agreed-upon price less (net of) the discount offered. 

Credit Losses (Bad Debts) exist as uncollectible accounts.

<mark class="formula"> Notes Receivable = Face Amount * Annual Rate * Fraction of Annual Period</mark>
(9/12)*.06*2000
GAAP requires their fair value in disclosure notes. Fair value changes over time can be recognized as gains or losses in the income statements.
GAAP = More Disaggregation.

Bank Overdrafts: US GAAP treats them as liabilities, but IFRS lets them be offset against other cash accounts when payable on demand

Effective Interest Method: outstanding balance is increased by interest rate

Selling Arrangements: factoring & securitization

Inventories & Measurement

Inventory
- assets the company intends to sell in the normal course of business
- has in production for future sale
- uses currently in the production of goods to be sold

Inventory Systems
1) Perpetual Inventory System: inventory and cogs updated with every transaction 

2) Periodic Inventory System: physical count

DVL LIFO: Dollar-Value LIFO consists of pools of items that are likely to face the same cost change pressures, not similar physical units.
- upon adoption, the first year is the base year, with cost index set at 1:00. Indexes rise across years; methods exists, such as double-extension method or link-chain method. 
- a LIFO layer is added wen current period ending inventory at base-year cost has increased


---------- HW2 

FOB Shipping Point: legal ownership transfers upon shipment
FOB Destination: legal ownership transfers upon receipt by buyer

Purchase Discounts:
- Gross Method: inventory debited, accounts payable credited for whole amount, 

- Net Method: inventory debited, accounts payable credited for discounted amount. Purchase Discounts Lost debited for difference at end of payment.

Inventories: Additional Issues
- Inventory Write-downs: GAAP requires evaluation of inventory at period end, and unsold items may need discounting

Two Methods:
- Lower of Cost or Net Realizable Value: for non-LIFO & non-RIM (retail inventory method)
- Lower of Cost or Market: for LIFO & RIM
-- both reduce reported inventory & net income, and amount varies between them



Net Realizable Value (NRV): estimated selling price of inventory in ordinary course of business, reduced by reasonably predictable costs of Completion, Disposal, & Transportation (commissions & shipping)

Lower of Cost or Market (LCM): based on inventory's current replacement cost by purchase or reproduction
- should not be greater than Net Realizable Value; Market CEILING
- should not be less than Net Realizable Value reduction by an Allowance for an approximate normal profit margin (NPM); Market FLOOR

Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets: Acquisition

Initial Valuation: include purchase price and all expenditures necessary to bring the asset to its desired condition and location

Lump-Sum: many assets could be purchased with a lump-sum, but they must be individually evaluated based on their fair values. 
- greater fair values by item are scaled by percentage to lump sum 

Non-Cash Acquisitions: bought with =>
- deferred payments (notes payable)
- issuance of equity securities 
- donated assets
- exchanges of non-monetary assets for other assets
-- Asset acquired is recorded at its fair value!
1. Fair value of assets given 2. of assets received, if more clearly evident

Realistic Interest Rate: provided a face value, with interest reflected in annual due payments. Dr. Property, Cr. Notes payable (face). Equipment Value = Face Value of Note

Exchanges
Non-monetary Asset Exchange: if asset values are not equal, cash will equalize values. E.g. trading old truck for new one.
1. Record new asset at Fair Value
2. Remove Book Value of Non-monetary asset given (Book Value = recorded cost of old asset - accumulated depreciation)
3. Record any Cash received or paid
4. Record any Gain or Loss: difference between Fair Value & Book Value of Asset given up. Fair Value > Book Value ? Gain : Loss

Fair Value Not Determinable?
- Modified Step 1.: Book value of Assets given up + Cash to record new Asset

Self-Constructed Asset: no external transaction to establish exchange price.
1. Determining the amount of the company's indirect manufacturing costs (overhead) to be allocated to the construction
2. Deciding on the proper treatment of interest (actual or implicit) incurred during construction

Donation: asset received, revenue recognized since it's implicit that the donor is receiving a benefit. GAAP specifies no specific offsetting account

Average Accumulated Expenditures
- the amount capitalized is only the portion of interest cost incurred during construction that could have been avoided if expenditures for the asset had not been made. Average is used for evenly spaced expenditures.
- Not evenly incurred? Then a weighted average is used by time-weighting individual expenditures or groups by number of months from their incurrence to the end of the construction period.

R&D
- high degree of uncertainty of future benefit
- expensed in periods as incurred, as per FASB taking a conservative approach
- assets may be understated and expenses overstated
- includes salaries, wages, other personnel labor in R&D activity, and cost of materials, equipment, facilities, intangibles, services, allocation of indirect cost. 
- General & Administrative Costs should NOT be included unless closely tied.

Cost Allocation
- process of costing over periods used to produce revenues
- purchase value is included in asset value

PP&E: Depreciation
Natural Resources: Depletion
Intangible Assets: Amortization
- all are product costs to be included as part of cost of Inventory IN MANUFACTURE 
Support Equipment (in office e.g.): period expenses in Income Statement

Factors in Process
1. Service Life (can be below physical life or legal life for intangibles)
2. Allocation Base
3. Allocation Method
- Residual Value: amount expected to receive after service life
- Depreciable Base = Capitalized Cost - Estimated Residual Value (determine amount expected to use up per period) [GAAP: should be systematic and rational]
- Methods: time-based & activity-based

Straight-Line Method:
- equal amount of depreciable base is allocated to each year of service life
Annual Depreciation = Depreciable Base / # Years in Asset's Life

Declining Balance Method
Book Value * Depreciation Rate (100 / yrs)
Double-Declining Rate: 200%

<mark class="formula">Sum-of-Years'-Digits =
(Yrs of Service Life) / 
(Yrs of Service Life digits sum)</mark>

Activity-Based Method:
Units of Production Method:
- <mark class="formula">AVG Depreciation Rate = Depreciable Base / Total # Units to Produce</mark>

Software Amortization
1. <mark class="formula">Percentage-of-Revenue Method = 
(Revenue / Estimated Product Revenue) * Costs Incurred</mark>
2. Straight-Line Method
 - Do both; Choose higher amount

Impairment Loss
1. Recoverability Test: estimated non-discounted future cash flows would be less than book value
2. Measurement: recorded for difference between book value and its DISCOUNTED fair value (discounted PV of future cash flows)
- if recognized: written-down book value becomes new cost base
- later recovery is prohibited
