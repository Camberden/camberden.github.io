	A Fiscal-Year determines annual reporting dues. They could be the calendar year, a 52-week period, or 12 consecutive months. NC is July 1st to June 30th.

Adjustments keep it such that Revenues are recorded when services are actually provided. Expenses shall recorded in the same manner; this is "Matching." This conforms to GAAP.

4 Adjustments: deferral of expense, revenue; accrued expense, revenue

1. Determine what current account balance equals
2. Determine what the current account balance should equal.
3. Record an adjusting entry to get from step 1 to step 2

Journalize an ADJUSTING ENTRY at the end of an accounting period.

CREATE expense account from which to send adjustments of a Prepaid or Current Asset Account. This is "Expensing" of current assets. Supplies are counted just like inmates at the end. The EXPENSE is the DEBIT. The credits to the Asset Account are credited at the End-Of-Month and are the same as the debits of the corresponding Expense Account.

Plant Assets (Property, Plant, and Equipment; PP&E).  
Longterm and tangible. Depreciating longer term assets.  
They have a "useful life." Should last for over a YEAR.

Accrued expenses are Accrued liabilities, incurred in a period that are both unpaid and unrecorded.

Accrued Expenses are Liabilities:

* increases a liability increases expense in Income Statement
* increases Liability, Balance Sheet accounting

At the end of month, employees may be paid but the days between payment and end-of-month must be recorded.

Salaries expense must be days x daily rate.  
Salaries payable must increase.

The Closing Entries:

The revenues, expenses, and dividends "disappear" through the closing of those accounts from the adjusted trail balance. Revenues, expenses, dividends, and income summary accounts are TEMPORARY accounts that do not appear in the Post-Closing Trial Balance.

Income summary is the footer to revenues and the header to the expenses. Then, in the third entry, it itself is closed by crediting retained earnings. Finally, retained earnings less dividends closes the final step of closing. 

Accounting Cycle:

The order of steps in creating financial statements. It's a cycle because it's all repeated every closing period.

1\. Analyze transactions

2\. Journalize

3\. Post

4\. Prepare Unadjusted Trial-Balance

5\. Adjust and post accounts

6\. Prepare Adjusted Trial-Balance

7\. Prepare financial statements

8\. Close Accounts

9\. Prepare Post-Closing Trial Balance

(10). Reverse and Post (Optional)

<mark class="formula"> profitMargin = netIncome / netSales</mark>

18000 / 90000 previous year 20%

20000 / 100000 current year: 20%

<mark class="formula">currentRatio = currentAssets / currentLiabilities;</mark>

A currentRatio of < .1 = doubt on paying back debt!

A WorkSheet is created BEFORE END OF PERIOD & BEFORE THE ADJUSTING PROCESS. This aids in the preparation of financial statements.

Steps:

1\. Account # ; Unadjusted Trial Balance Debits and Credits (their balances)

2\. Enter Adjustments

3\. Prepare the Adjusted Trial Balance

4\. Sorting from Adjusted Trial Balance to both Income Statement and Balance Sheet

Expenses go to Income Statement Debit column

Revenues go to the Income Statement Credit column

Assets and Dividends to the Balance Sheet Debit column

Liabilities, Accumulated Depreciation, Common Stock, Retained Earnings, go to the Balance Sheet Credit column

  

Classified/Unclassified Balance Sheets

Operating Cycle: time between performance of services to collecting cash; most operating cycles are less that one year. Cycles are used to decide which assets and liabilities are CURRENT. At a minimum, a Classified Balance Sheet distinguishes CURRENT (within Operating Cycle) and NON-CURRENT (outside of it).

Unclassified: broadly groups assets, liabilities, and equity.

Classified: Lists current BEFORE non-current; items in CURRENT are listed in order by how QUICKLY they will be converted to or PAID IN CASH.

On Classified Balance Sheet:

Current Assets: are: 

 Cash and other assets expected to be sold, collected, or used within 1 year or the company's operating cycle, whichever is longer: examples: cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, short-term notes receivable, prepaid-expenses, SUPPLIES, goods for sale "merchandise" or "inventory."

Non-Current Assets: are:

Long-Term-Investments: expected to be held for more than one year; this includes longer-term NOTES RECEIVABLE & investments in stocks and bonds. There can be short-term notes receivable but they are current assets.

Plant assets like equipment, buildings, and land.

Intangible Assets: trademarks, patents, copyrights, franchises, good-will.

Equity is NOT separated into current and non-current categories.


\----- Smart-book Question Notes:

Supplies are a pre-paid asset.

Debit the unpaid salaries.

Unearned Revenue: cash is received in advance for services. They are reported on the balance sheet.

Up the Cash; Credit the Unearned Revenue (a LIABILITY) ; ON ADJUSTMENT: Debit the Unearned Revenue portion and credit the Earned Revenue as it comes. Because Cash Asset was Debited, to balance the sheet, the other side must become fully credited. Consulting revenue will become fully credited. The liability of Unearned becomes equity of Earned.

Banker's Rule: Interest computations use a 360-day year.

Accrued Revenue: increase a revenue; increase an asset.

Accrued Interest Revenue: debit Interest Receivable; credit Interest Revenue.

EVERY ADJUSTING ENTRY: affects 1 Income Statement Account (Revenue or Expense) and 1 Balance Sheet Account (Asset or Liability)!

Unearned Stuff? You're CREATING a Liability! Balance that with an income statement account (expense). Then, debits before credits; liabilities are credit-normal.

Adjusting Entries are due at the end of an accounting period, therefore, equipment bought in the middle of the year would require adjustment.

Adjusted Trial Balance would typically have more accounts listed because some accounts are changed during adjustment, for instance, Accumulated Depreciation, Salaries Payable, and Supplies Expense

Temporary Account: relate to one accounting period, such as Income Statement Accounts (expense, revenue), Dividends Account, and the Income Summary Account. CLOSING PROCESS APPLIES TO ONLY TEMPORARY ACCOUNTS. Temporary Accounts are closed to Zero.

HOMEWORK

Recognizing Expenses
A prepaid expenses like hotel rooms for a following month is not recognized in Accrual Based Accounting as for the current period. Prepaid asset?

Prepaid Assets like Prepaid Insurance:
determine current balance, determine what it should be, adjust from step 1 to step 2. Current = 5000, Payments show 1000 remains unexpired at year end. Therefore, adjust 4000.
All adjustments change one Income Statement Account (revenue or expense) and one Balance Sheet Account (asset on credit, liability).

Income Summary: the merging of expenses and revenues into retained earnings, and removing dividend account.

Accumulated Depreciation is always LESS the asset itself in the asset section!

MERCHANDISER ACCOUNTING
Merchandising is buying inventory intended for sale.
There are two merchandisers: wholesalers and retailers. The operating cycle is A. Purchases B. Merchandise Inventory C. Credit Sales D. Accounts Receivable E. Cash Collection.

Cost of Goods Sold appears on the INCOME statement; often largest deduction from net sales. The result is Gross Profit. Minus expenses would be Net Income.

Beginning Inventory + Net Purchases = Cost of Goods Sold + Ending Inventory.

Perpetual Inventory System: updated after each purchase.
Periodic Inventory System: reported after a period.

Invoice: follows a credit payment and outlines the seller, invoice date, purchaser, order date, credit terms (upcoming payments and their dates), freight terms, goods, total invoice amount, and net amount. n/30 = net 30 days.

Discounts can be applied to incentivize earlier payment: 2/10, n/30 (Deduct 2% of invoice if made within first 10 days of invoice date).

Title Transfers:
FOB Shipping Point: buyer owns goods in transit. Dr. Merch Inventory Cr. Cash.
FOB Destination: seller owns goods in transit. Dr. Delivery Expense Cr. Cash.

Itemized Costs of Purchases:
invoice cost of merch LESS discounts, returns, and allowances ADD cost of transportation.

Each sale of merch as two parts:

Revenue recorded and asset increased from customer.
Cost of goods sold incurred and asset decreased to the customer.
Dr. Cost of Goods Sold Cr. Merchandise Inventory

Shrinkage:
A cost in an of itself; Dr. Cost of Goods Cr. Merchandise Inventory

Merchandisers TEMP Accounts to Close:
Sales; Sales Discounts; Sales Returns and Allowances; Cost of Goods Sold

Closing:
Sales Dr.
Income Summary Cr.

Expenses and Sales stuff (discounts, returns and allowances, cost of goods sold): Dr. Income Summary Cr. Expenses sales stuff

Multi-Step Income Statement:
for merchandisers:
it has the Gross Profit (sales, LESS sales discounts, sales returns and allowances, minus cost of goods sold), the Income from Expenses section, and Net Income section.

Selling Expenses: costs to market

General and Admin Expenses: costs to keep business running

Single-Step Income Statement:
Groups Revenues like sales, revenues, gain on sales; and Expenses, such as Costs of Goods Sold, Selling Expenses, General Administration Expenses etc.
The difference is Net Income.

Single-Step doesn't discriminate relation between Selling and Administrative.

Inventory is LESS Liquid than Accounts Receivable.

Acid-Test Ratio: tests ability to pay back debts but concerns Quick Assets (more Liquid) over Current Liabilities,.

Quick Assets: Cash and Cash Equivalents + Short Term Investments + Current Receivables < 1.10 shows Liabilities exceed Quick Assets. Near to 1.0 is best.

<mark class="formula">Gross Margin Ratio = Net Sales - Cost of Goods Cold / Net Sales</mark>

22842 | 23822 | 23241.60 | 23572

COST ACCOUNTING
Weighted Average:
average cost of inventory at end of period.
Cost of Goods Available for Sale / Units Available for Sale

Costs assigned to End of Year Inventory using one of 4 costing methods: FIFO, LIFO,
Weighted Average or Specific Identification.

Inventory is recorded at the market value of Replacing Inventory when Net Market Value is lower than Cost. Inventory is recorded at the Balance Sheet at the LOWER of Cost or Market value (LCM).

Market Value is replacement cost for LIFO, but Net Realizable Value for other methods. When Market Value is lower than Cost of Inventory, a Loss is recorded.

Total Cost ||| Total Market ||| LCM Applied to Items

Market Adjust: Cr. Merchandise Inventory Account Dr. Cost of Goods Sold

Inventory Errors:
Item missed or counted twice; purchase discount overlooked:

NET INCOME = Beginning Inventory + Net Purchases - Ending Inventory = Cost of Goods Sold

An error in Inventory is said to be Self Correcting as long as Year 3 is Inventoried Properly. Year 1 Ending inventory becomes Year 2 Beginning Inventory; Year 1 Cost and Year 2 Cost is affected.

<mark class="formula">Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / AVG Inventory</mark>
This Ratio shows Management Control of Inventory.

<mark class="formula">Days' Sales in Inventory = (Ending Inventory / Cost of Goods Sold) * 365</mark>

IMPORTANT: assigning costs per unit of inventory. Each of 4 methods depends on type of product and storage. Assuming same item sold att differentt points in May: Sales at differnetn costs are accounted for by chosen method. FIFO LIFO WA SI

FIFO: costs flow in order incurred.
"We want to sell milk in a FIFO basis. The first item sold is the first that arrived." Put the older milk first; regardless if customer finds newer milk gallon.

LIFO: costs flow in reverse order incurred
"Hard candy put in big barrel, doesn't matter when purchased. It must be kept full. It's a business choice."

WA (Weighted Average): Costs flow at an average of costs available.
"Gasoline sold from station from underground tank."
Cost of Goods Available / Units Available for Sale

SI (Specific Identification): requires records of all specific costs of items sold.
Ending inventory is also segregated by specific cost.
2045 + 2685 costs

Weighted Average is calculated as purchases happen in a perpetual system.

100$ for first remainder; CARRIES OVER

5 @ 100
35 @ 114

Costs of Goods Sold = Expense DrEAD

---------- HW

Merchandise Inventory = (Storage, Selling, Insurance, and Invoice Costs).

Perishables have an Actual Physical Flow of FIFO????? duh.

FIFO would typically report highest gross profit and net income Because COGS is lowest!

13.5 * 14
180 + 189 / 24
369/24

Net Income Lower? COGS higher!

48 + 120 + 36

In a declining cost market, LIFO would have highest taxes and highest ending inventory

Internal Control System:
Policy and Procedure for:
Protecting Assets, Ensuring Reliable Accounting, Promoting Efficient Operations, and Upholding Company Policies

Sarbanes-Oxley Act:
Requires managers and auditors to document and verify internal controls.

The company must have effective internal controls
Auditors must evaluate internal controls
Auditors' work is overseen by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)
-Violators receive harsh penalties, up to 25 years in pRiSoN with fines.
Principles of Internal Control (7):

Establish Responsibilities: who can be held accountable? separate registers, for instance.
Maintain Adequate Records: numbering and paper trails for accountability
Insure Assets and Bond Key Employees: insured against loses and employees are "bonded" so that people don't steal assets
Separate Record-keeping from Custody of Assets: a person who controls or has access to an asset must not keep the accounting records.
Divide Responsibility for Related Transactions: separate duties such that one employee can check/balance another.
Apply Technological Controls: apps, registers, locks, electronic files, time-clocks, scanners (access control, badging, fingerprinting etc.
Perform Regular and Independent Reviews: done by internal or external (3rd party) auditors not directly involved with the business activities; they assess effectiveness of internal control systems.
Technology on Internal Controls:

Reduce processing errors
Less human involvement could lead to software or automated issues going unnoticed.
More extensive testing of records
Separation of duties (the programmer shouldn't operate it)
New Evidence of Processing: can record additional transaction details. Tech focuses more on control and not on analysis.
Increased E-Commerce (issues such as credit card theft, identity theft, viruses could emerge)
Blockchain Ledger: new, more secure type of accounting ledger that is simultaneously updated and verify; nothing is destroyed or hidden.
Limitations of Internal Control:

Human Error or Fraud:
Fraud Triangle: Opportunity, Pressure/Incentive, Rationalization/Attitude
Cost-Benefit Constraint: costs of internal controls must not exceed their benefits. Must consider all factors, including not to affect morale. They must be determined to have a net benefit to the company.
Cash

Most liquid of all assets, and most able to be hidden.
Guidelines for Controls over Cash:

Separate the handling of cash from the record-keeping of cash.
Promptly deposit cash receipts in a bank
Make cash payments by check (or electronic funds transfer [EFT])
Liquidity: Ability of a company's ability to pay for its current liabilities.
Liquid Assets are most quickly converted to cash or can more easily offset liabilities. They are listed first on the balance sheet's asset section.

Criteria for Cash Equivalents:

Readily convertible to a known cash amount. NOT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TYPICALLY
Close enough to their due date so that their market value will not greatly change. USUALLY WITHIN 3 MONTHS OF DUE DATE.
Cash Management:

Plan cash receipts to meet cash payments when due.
Keep a minimum amount of cash to operate.
Cash Management Strategies:
-Encourage collection of receivables

Delay payment of liabilities
Keep only necessary levels of assets
Plan expenditures
Invest excess cash (cash from seasonal cycles could be invested in short term growth accounts).
Cash Receipts:

Registers have locked-in permanent records. The operator should not have access to this. Supervisor sends this to Company Cashier. The record is the basis for a journal entry. The clerk and cashier have access to cash but not accounting records. The accountant has access to the records, but not the actual cash.
Clerk -> Cash & Cash Receipt from Register (records amount and turns in record to Company Cashier)
Company Cashier -> Receives Cash Receipt and Register Receipt (Has access to Cash but no access to permanent record); Prepares Journal Entry.
Supervisor -> Reads Register Data, prepares Register Sheet; Compares to Cash Receipt (sends both to Company Cashier. Doesn't handle Cash)

Cash Over and Short Account:

Cr. Cash Over and Short for excess Cash
Dr. Cash Over and Short for missing Cash
Sales appears at bottom as Cr. ; Cash Dr.
Excess could be Misc. Revenues; Missing could be Misc. Expenses.
Cash Receipts by Mail:

best done with 2 or more employees
List of Money Received: sender names, amount, why sent.
Copies:
Sent with money to Cashier
Sent to Record-Keeper in the Accounting Area
Kept by Clerk who opened Mail
Control of Cash Payments:

Most large thefts is from FAKE INVOICES.
Good Practice: require all payments by Check.
Small Businesses could have just the owner sign Checks.
Large Businesses must rely on Internal Controls
Voucher System establishes Procedures for:

Verifying, approving, and recording liabilities for cash payments
Issuing checks for payment of verified, approved, and recorded liabilities.
LIABILITIES MUST BE VERIFIED before paying them off, basically!
Separate Departments collaborate in verification (e.g. Accounting, Receiving, Purchasing, Requesting)
There are Documents created for these actions: Purchase Requisition, Invoice, Check etc.
Petty Cash Control:

to avoid writing checks for small amounts (fees, low-cost supplies) for a week/month
Petty Cash Account
The fund can be reimbursed after the petty expenses (MISC EXPENSES) are Dr. and the Petty Cash?? Account is Cr.
Increasing the Fund means to Dr. Petty Cash & Cr. Cash.
Should be notated in comments.
Cash Over and Short Account is used to notate errors during managing Petty Cash
TRANSPORTATION-IN IS MERCHANDISE INVENTORY
Petty Cash account does not change; it equals the fund balance, always, unless fund is increased or decreased.
Bank Account:
Record setup by Bank for Customer.
Signature Card: Debit Card.

Bank Statement:
typically sent to depositor once a month. Shows accounts balances.

Bank Reconciliation:
Verifies accuracy of both bank statement and cash accounts of business. This can happen due to out-of-sync events and transactions.
Common Causes:

Outstanding Checks
Deposits in Transit
Bank Fees and NSF (non-sufficient funds) Checks
Additions for Collection of Notes (memo sent)
Bank Error or Depositor Error
Bank Balance... # | Book Balance... #
Add & Deduct:

Timing Differences
Any Errors
Adjusted Bank Bal... #
Preparing Bank Reconciliation:

Enter bank balance taken from the bank statement
Add unrecorded deposits (Deposit in transit) and bank errors understating the bank balance
Subtract any Outstanding Checks (coming out of account) and bank errors overstating the bank balance from the bank balance
Compute the adjusted bank balance
Enter cash account book balance taken from the accounting records
Add any unrecorded cash receipts (like interest) and errors understating the book balance to the book balance
Subtract any unrecorded bank fees, NSF checks, and errors overstating the book balance and deduct them from the book balance.
Compute adjusted book balance.
IF 4 & 8 are equal, then it's RECONCILED.

Record Credit Sales: Dr. Receivable Cr. Sales (income statement)
Record Collection of Credit Sales: Dr. Cash Asset Cr. Receivable
Credit Card Sales:

charge Fee to seller
is journaled as Credit Card Expense Dr.
Bad Debts:

Uncollectible Accounts
Two Methods:

Direct Write-off Method:
Dr. Bad Debts Expense Cr. Receivable
TO RECOVER: Cr. Bad Debts, Dr. Receivable; Cr. Receivable Dr. Cash
ONLY RECOVER WHAT IS PAID

Does not best match sales and expenses.
Permitted when bad debts are immaterial
Materiality Constraint permits use of Direct Write-Off Method
GAAP-approved if results approximate the Allowance Method
Allowance Method:

Matches estimated loss to Sales produced
Two Advantages:
Records bad debts expense in the period when the related sales are recorded.
Reports accounts receivable at estimated amount to be collected.
BAD DEBTS EXPENSE on Income Statement.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is a Contra-Asset Account
Accounts Receivable ... $
Less: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ... $
Estimating Bad Debts:
Percent of Sales Method: based on the income statement relation between bad debts and sales; the "Income Statement Method"
Accounts Receivable Method:

Percent of Accounts Receivable: A/R x % = Est.
Adjusts the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Balance Reported
EQUAL to the ESTIMATE of Uncollectible A/R
Updates for next year: CROSS-REFERENCE previous year's write-offs. The differnce between previous Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and what was actually spent for it PLUS adjustment to meet new estimate
Aging of Accounts Receivable

Receivables are classified by how long they are past due date
The longer an amount is past due, the less likely it is to be collected
Aged amounts are used to estimate the percent of each uncollectible class
DAYS PAST DUE are assigned a PERCENTAGE on a Schedule of Accounts Receivable

COMPANY BORROWS MONEY BY PLEDGING A/R FOR LOAN

Dr. Case Cr. Notes Payable

Does not transfer risk of bad debts, enables a company to raise case, to retain ownership of its receivables, and should be disclosed in financial statements

Accounts Receivable Turnover:
Measures how often receivables are collected.
Net Sales / AVG A/R, net.

High Turnover: could be laxer to increase sales.
Low Turnover: should be stricter with credit terms to keep money out of receivables

Appraised Value

Apportioned Cost: Find Total appraised value of assets, then determine percentage of total each asset is based on appraised value total.

Then, multiply the purchase cost by that percentage to find Apportioned Cost which should add up to Lump Sum Price.

Paid 90000 Lump;
Land appraised @ 30000
Improvements appraised @ 10000
Building appraised @ 60000
Appraised Total = 100000
30%; 10%; 60%;

27000 ; 9000 ; 54000

<mark class="formula">Straight-Line Depreciation = Cost - Salvage Value / Useful Life in Periods</mark>
Charges same amount of depreciation over the course of an asset's useful life.

10000 - 1000 / 5 years = 1800 per year.

Units-of-Production Method:
Used when certain periods have productive times and unused times.
<mark class="formula"> Depreciation Per Unit = Cost - Salvage (Depreciable Cost) / TOTAL Units of Production</mark>

Depreciation per unit is reported and the cost of producing each unit is multiplied.

30000 value
60000units is useful life.
30000 / 60000 = .5 per unit
23000units in 2022 = 11500

<mark class="formula">Declining Balance Method = Straight-Line Method * 2 = Double-Declining Balance Rate</mark>
It's an Accelerated Depreciation Method.


<mark class="formula">Depreciation Expense = Double-Declining Rate * Beginning-Period Book Value</mark>

33000cost - 3000salvage / 3 useful years = 10000 per year (33.3%) * 2 = 66.6% = 20000

66.6% OF WHAT??? Not 30000 apparently.
Began period with 33000 yes? 22000 then, I'm going with that.

Can't go Below Salvage! Last Year would be the difference between last balance and salvage.

MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System):
US Federal Income Tax Law requires Straight-Line depreciation for some assets and Accelerated depreciation for most others. MACRS is not acceptable for financial reporting because it does not consider useful life or salvage value.

Changes is Estimates:
We can revise salvage value, useful life, and depreciation, but must use current period's data. The current depreciated book value less revised salvage value over revised useful life.

4yr useful life. 12000original, 2000salvage.
yr1=10000
yr2=8000
yr3=6000
6000 current book value - 1200 new salvage value = 4800 depreciable cost
6yr useful life, so 2 years now remain.

4800/2 = 2400 OOOH THREE YEARS REMAIN; 3/6 WERE USED, NOT 4.

Known Liabilities:

measurable obligations arising from agreements, contracts, or laws.
Payroll Liabilities:

salaries, wages, benefits, payroll taxes
FICA: Federal Insurance Contributions Act

Social Security taxes (for incomes under $137700)
Medicare taxes
FPL: Federal Poverty Level

$15060 for a single person.
Medicaid covers individuals in participating states under 138% of FPL following the Affordable Care Act of 2010
Employers must pay FICA taxes on payroll.
Self-employed must pay both employee and employer FICA taxes.

Employers must pay FUTA: Federal Unemployment Tax Act taxes on wages and salaries total earned under $7000.
This can be reduced by paying SUTA: State unemployment Tax Act taxes for the state's own unemployment fund. The rate paid is adjusted based on the employer's Merit Rating based on stability in employing workers.

Internal Controls of Payroll:

Employee Hiring
Payroll Preparation
Timekeeping
Payroll Payment
Multiperiod Known Liabilities:

3YR Subscription would be debited as Unearned Revenue in later periods, but seen as a Current Portion of Long-Term Debt for current period.
"8.5% of fraud connected to payroll; $72000 median loss per fraud; 24months median time to uncover"

Contingent Liability:

potential obligation that depends on a future event arising from a past transaction or event: pending lawsuit
Conditions:

Record Liability: the future event is probable and the amount owed can be reasonably estimated: warranties, vacation pay, income taxes
Disclose in Notes: the future event is reasonably possible.
No Disclosure: the future event is remote and unlikely.
Applied to: potential legal claims, debt guarantees (like an athlete ending service due to injury), and other contingencies (environmental damages, taxes assessments, insurance losses, and government investigations)

Uncertainties Non-Contingent: random natural disasters, conflicts, new technologies did not arise from past transactions, so they are not disclosed.

Times Interest Earned Ratio:

A measure of ability to pay liabilities, especially fixed ones (like interest) with variable income and expenses.

<mark class="formula">Times Interest Earned = Income Before Interest Expense and Income Taxes / Interest Expense</mark>

if Times Interest Earned falls below around 1.5, a business will likely be at risk of not being able to pay its liabilities.

Corporation: separate from its owners with many same legal rights as a person.

Advantages:

Separate Legal Entity
Limited LIability
Transferable Ownership Rights
Continuous Life
No Mutual Agency for Stockholders
Easier Capital Accumulation
Disadvantages:

Government Regulation
Corporate Taxation (& double taxation)
Charter: applied for by initial stockholders called promoters or incorporators, granted by a State Government!
Bylaws: guidelines that govern a corporation

Common Stock: stock when a corporation has one class of stock

Corporation Charter grants specific rights;
State Laws grant general rights.

Usual Rights:

voting at stockholder meetings
sell or dispose of stock
purchase proportional share to what's currently owned as a preemptive right.
Receive same dividend for common share
Registrar: keeps list of stockholders
Transfer Agent: assists with purchases and sales of shares

Organization Costs: costs to start a corporation including legal fees, promoter's fees, and payments for a charter. Dr. Organization Expenses

Stockholder meetings are held at least once a year typically, and a non-attendee can give voting rights to an agent by proxy, a document that gives agent right to vote.

Authorized Stock: number of shares a corporation's charter allows it to sell. Usually exceeds amount of shares issued by a large amount. Outstanding (Held) Stock: held by stockholders. No journal entry needed to authorize stock.

Selling (Issuing) Stock: direct sale is from corporation to buyer; indirect sale is through payment of a brokerage house (investment banker) to sell stock. Some Underwrite Stock: they buy and resell to investors.

Par Value Stock: amount assigned per share by charter. Can establish a Minimum Legal Capital, which is a minimum purchase of stock to minimize risk.

No-Par Value Stock: not assigned an amount per charter. Stated Value Stock is a No-Par Stock. All do not affect stock's market value.

Stockholder's Equity: "Paid-in-Capital" (contributed capital) is total amount received in exchange for stock AND retained earnings (cumulative net income and loss)

Cash Dividends: distributions of cash to stockholders. Payment is determined by directors. They may keep it to invest in growth, meet emergencies, or pay off debt.

Date of Declaration: when directors vote to pay a dividend.
Date of Record: date receiving stockholders are identified
Date of Payment: when corporation makes payment

Retained Earnings ...
... Common Dividend Payable ...

Common Dividend Payable ...
... Cash ...

Stock Dividends: distribution of additional shares of its stock to stockholders without payment in return. Stock Dividends do not reduce assets and equity, but instead transfer a portion of equity from Retained Earnings to Contributed Capital (capitalizing Retained Earnings). Accounting for Stock Dividends depend on whether large or small.

Small Stock Dividend: distribution of 25% or less of previously outstanding shares. Recorded by capitalizing Retained Earnings for an amount equal to the MARKET value of shares.
Large Stock Dividend: distribution of more than 25% of previously outstanding shares; recorded by capitalizing Retained Earnings for the Par or Stated value of stock.

Stock Split: No journal entry for splitting stock into multiple stocks. Cost per stock or par would decrease according to split. e.g. 10000 stock @ 20$ par becomes 20000 stock @ 10 par; stockholders retain equivalent.
Par Table: shows cost per stock and par value.

Preferred Stock: has special rights that give it priority over Common Stock in one or more areas. Preferred Stock is its own account, and is paid out earlier than Common Stock.

Cumulative Preferred Stock: grants right to be paid for current and prior periods' unpaid dividends before Common Stockholders. If unpaid dividend amount can't cover, or directors decide against payment, the dividend is called Dividend in Arrears. There is no guarantee of payment, and it is not a liability; only reported as a memo on Financial Statements.
Noncumulative Preferred Stock: only includes rights for current-period dividends.

Preferred Stock Reasons: raising capital without affording voting rights, expected returns on Common Stock seem low, and leverage.

Dividend Rate on Preferred Stock < Rate Corporation earns on Assets ? Issuing Preferred Stock increases rate earned by Common Stockholders

Frequency of Preferred Stock: None 73%, Issued 27%

Treasury Stock: "Stock Buyback;" A corporation buys its own stock, similar to Unissued Stock. For reasons below:

To use shares to buy another corp.
To avoid takeover of the company
To give them to employees as compensation.
To maintain a strong market for their stock or to show confidence in current price.

Statement of Retained Earnings: generally cumulative net income minus net losses and dividends declared. Retained Earnings do not imply a certain amount of cash or other assets available to pay stockholders.

Restrictions and Appropriations on Retained Earnings:
Statutory (legal) Restriction: is to limit Treasury Stock purchases to the amount of Retained Earnings.
Contractual Restriction: a loan agreement that restricts paying dividends beyond a specified amount of Retained Earnings.

Prior Period Adjustments: corrections of material errors in past financial statements: math errors, improper accounting, missed facts. Reported on STATEMENT of RETAINED EARNINGS, net of any income tax effects. For events prior to the earliest period reported in current set of financial statements.

Many items on Financial Statements are based on estimates. Inaccuracies in them are not errors to adjust, but rather estimates to adjust in current and future periods.

Statement of Stockholders' Equity: lists the beginning and ending balances of key equity accounts and described the changes that occur during that period.
| Common Stock | Paid-In Capital Excess of Par | Retained Earnings | Treasury Stock | Total Equity

---------- Formulas

Earnings Per Share (EPS): income earned per share of outstanding Common Stock

Basic EPS = Net Income - Preferred Dividends / Weighted-AVG Common Shares Outstanding

CUMULATIVE PREF.DIV Subtracted when Declared in same period

Price-Earnings (PE) Ratio: interpreted as what price the market is willing to pay for a company's current earnings stream. Higher means better expectations of future earnings. "For each ___ of stock, 1$ is earned"

OVERPRICED? ~ > 20
UNDERPRICED? ~ < 5 to 8
PE Ratio = Market Value per Share / Earnings per Share

Dividend Yield: rate of dividend payouts. Higher large dividend payouts are known as income stocks which deliver recurring cash flows.

Statement of Cash Flows: reports cash inflows (receipts) and outflows (payments). Separated into Operating, Investing, and Financing activities.

Operating Cash Flows
| Current Assets
| Current Liabilities

Investing Cash Flows
| Long-Term Assets

Financing Activities
| Long-Term Liabilities and Equity

Some Investing and Financing Activities don't affect Cash Flows e.g. purchase of long-term assets for long-term notes payable.

5-Steps of Cash Flow Statement

Compute net increase or decrease in cash
Compute net cash from or for operating activities
investing activities
financing activities
Compute net cash from all sources; then prove it by adding it to beginning cash to get ending cash
Second Approach (Non-Cash Analysis)

Cash = Liabilities + Equity - Non-cash Assets

Operating Cash Flows

Direct Method (1%)

separately lists operating cash receipts and payments; payments are subtracted from receipts.
Indirect Method (99%)
Reports net income and then adjusts it for items that do not affect cash. It does not report individual items of cash inflows and cash outflows from operating activities.
Investing Cash Flows

Three step analysis for changes in all long-term asset accounts and any current accounts for notes receivable and investments in securities.
Identify Changes in Investing-related Accounts
Determine the Cash Effects using T-accounts and Reconstructed Entries
Report the Cash Flow Effects
Financing Cash Flows

Identify changes in financing related accounts
determine the cash effects using T-accounts and reconstructed entries
report the cash flow effects.
Examples of Financing Activities: receiving cash from issuing debt or repaying amounts borrowed and receiving cash from or distributing cash to owners

<mark class="formula">Cash Flow on Total Assets =
Cash Flow from Operations / AVG total assets.</mark>
The ratio = actual cash flows; Helps estimate amount and timing of cash flows from operating activities.

---------- HW

Notes Receivable is Investing

Gain in Common Stock value is an increase to financing. Financing: long-term debt, notes payable, bonds payable, common stock, retained earnings; non-current liability accounts and equity.

Depreciation and Amortization are added back to Net Income for Cash Flow compilation.

LOGIC of Adjustments!

Current Assets like A/R are Deducted from Net Income when increased, and Added to Net Income when decreased.
Current Liabilities like Wages Payable are Added to Net Income when Increased and Deducted from Net Income when decreased.
Non-Cash Expenses or losses are Added to Net Income
Non-Cash Revenues and Gains are Deducted from Net Income

Financial Statement Analysis

Internal Users want to improve company efficiency and effectiveness. External users want information to make better and more informed decisions in pursuing their goals.

Building Blocks of Analysis:
1: Liquidity and Efficiency: can meet short-term obligations and efficiently generate revenue
2: Solvency: can meet long term obligations and generate future revenue
3: Profitability: can provide financial rewards sufficient to attract and retain financing
4: Market Prospects: can generate positive market expectations.

General Purpose Financial Statements:
Balance Sheets, Income Statements, Statement of Retained Earnings, Statement of Cash Flows, Notes to the Financial Statements

Good? Bad? Avg.? performance?
- Gotta use Standards for Comparisons:
1: Intracompany: prior performance and relations between financial items
2: Competitor: one or more direct competitors of the company
3: Industry: stats
4: Guidelines: general standards from past exp. & personal judgements

Tools of Financial Analysis:
1: Horizontal Analysis: measuring financial condition across time (years; dollar change; percent change)
2: Vertical Analysis: measuring in reference to a base-amount (common-size analysis; for individual financial statement items, or groups of items)
3: Ratio Analysis: measurement of key relationships among key financial items

<mark class="formula">Percent Change = (Analysis Period Amount - Base Period Amount / Base Period Amount) * 100</mark>

Trend Analysis: line graph typically; patterns across data periods! 
<mark class="formula">Trend Percent = (Analysis Period Amount / Base Period Amount) * 100</mark>

Common-Size Comparative Balance Sheets usually use a base-amount like Total Assets as 100%; and Income Statements would use Revenue as 100%

Common-Size Percent = (Analysis Amount / Base Amount) * 100

Common-Size Income Statement can be displayed easily with Pie Chart. Yes.

Managerial Accounting: to provide useful information to management and other internal decision makers. 

Planning! Control! Strategy!
Gathering information for cost and control decisions.

No GAAP rules for Managerial Accounting.

Financial Accounting focuses on the whole company's past performance; managerial accounting focuses on a company's projects, processes, and divisions' current performance and future projections.

Managerial Accounting isn't only Monetary; it deals with non-monetary data like satisfaction and delivery times.

Fraud Triangle:
- Opportunity, Pressure, Rationalization

IMA (Institute of Management Accountants) outlines ethics for Managerial Accounting

Costs:
- Direct: cost-effectively traced to a cost-object like a product and labor costs to assemble
- Indirect: cannot be; manager salaries, building rent, maintenance salaries, depreciation

Capitalized as Inventory
- Product Costs (activities around producing product) with Direct materials, Direct labor, Indirect manufacturing costs

Expensed as Incurred
- Period Costs (activities associated with time itself) as with Selling, General Administrative Expenses, expensed in Income Statement

Manufacturing Costs
- Direct Materials [Prime Cost]
- Direct Labor [Prime Cost] [Conversion Cost]
- Overheads [Conversion Cost] (cannot be traced to specific productive activity)

Lean Principles
- fulfill social responsibility, satisfying customers, elimination of waste. 
- TQM (Total Quality Management), Just-in-Time Production, Value Chain aid in application of Lean.
- Triple Bottom Line: a focus on financial, social, and environmental measures.

... Add Beginning Finished Goods Inv.
=== Total Cost of Work in Process
... Less Work-In-Process Inv. Ending

---------- HW

Product / Period
Direct / Indirect

Finished Goods Beginning + Cost of Goods Manu - Finished Goods Ending = Cost of Goods Sold

Utilities for a Factory Plant are Product Costs, not Period.

Cost of hourly workers doing carpet cleaning for such cleaning company would be direct and variable cost.
Cost of those machines' straight-line depreciation would be Indirect Overhead, because their degradation is not tied to specific cleaning jobs.

Work-in-Process Inv. is included in Cost of Goods Manufactured

Cost Accounting
1: Job-Order Costing
2: Process Costing

Job-Order Production or Manufacturing:
- custom things, like custom factory machines, factory building, custom jewelry, tattoos, audits from a firm etc.
- Specifically designed for a specific customer
- Volume of production is typically low
- More than 1? Considered a Job Lot.

Process Production:
- Repetitive procedures to make similar products and services, high production volume, high standardization and low product flexibility

Jobs are separated in Work-In-Process Inv., Finished Goods Inv. and Cost of Goods Sold

Accumulated Costs follow Job Orders

Subsidiary Records:
- for managers; includes Raw Materials, Overhead Costs, Jobs in Process, and Finished Goods info.

Job Cost Sheet
- a document for each Job. 
- Only product costs are on the sheet
- Estimated Overhead cost incurred on the job is included

Job Order Costing in Service Businesses
- must estimate number of staff hours needed
- overhead rate is established
- they must consider the market and create a quote

Materials Cost Flows and Documents:
- Receiving Report => Materials Ledger Cards (updated for material purchases and issues for production) => (Direct Materials to Materials Requisitions to Job Cost Sheets ; Indirect Materials to Materials Requisitions to Factory Overhead Ledger)

Journal Entries
Raw Materials Inventory ...
... Accounts Payable ...
Work In Process Inventory ...

Labor Cost Flows and Documents
- Time Tickets: time spent for a job flow to Direct Labor
- Salary Contracts: flow to Indirect Labor as Overhead

Journal Entries

... Factory Wages Payable ...

Set Predetermined Overhead Rate and Apply Estimated Overhead
- Managers must determine what estimated Overhead Cost would be for a period.

Activity (Allocation) Base:
- related to production, like direct labor or machine hours, related to Overhead cost.

Record Actual Overhead
- Indirect Materials through Materials Requisitions
- Indirect Labor through Time Tickets
- Vouchers (authorizing payments for supplies or utilities)
- Adjusting Entries (like depreciations)
--- All are recorded with debits to the Factory Overhead general ledger account

Total Manufacturing costs include:
- Direct Materials
- Direct Labor
- Factory Overhead APPLIED (not Actual)

Income Statement:
- Sales less Cost of Goods Sold for Gross Profit
- Selling Expenses, General Administrative Expenses

Balance Sheet:
- Reports Inventory Account balances from the Schedule of Cost of Goods Manufactured (Direct Materials, Direct Labor, Factory Overhead Applied, Total Manufacture Costs + Beginning Work in Process Inventory minus Ending Work in Process Inventory, Cost of Goods Manufactured)

Overhead Costs Applied to Different Jobs
- Overhead Incurred ≠ Overhead Applied
- Actual Overhead is known at the end of the period
- Applied Overhead is estimated during the period

- May use Services in Process Inventory and Cost of Services
- Typically don't have Raw Materials, but may have Supplies Inventory
- Typically supplies are immaterial and can be considered Overhead
- Direct Labor is often used to apply Overhead

Process Operations:
- high level of standardization used to produce many things
- as opposed to Job Order Operations which is for custom things
- the processes are separate departments typically
- they extend to services as well
- tracks Direct Materials, Direct Materials, and Overhead
- measures unit costs at the end of a period
- the cost object is a process
- they use 1 Work In Process Inventory count per process

Step 1: Determine Physical Flow of Units
- Units to Account For => Units Accounted For

Step 2: Compute Equivalent Units of Products (EUP)
- EUP = whole units started and completed in the costs incurred in the period
- Exists because some units aren't completed by the end of the period but still need to be assigned costs
- Conversion costs occur during a process

Activity-Based Costing
- where an activity, task, operation etc. is what would cause Overhead costs to be incurred.
- includes: production setups, machine usage, fabrication, design, assembly, inspection.
- Steps:  
1: Identify activities and assign budgeted costs to activity cost pools
2: Compute an overhead activity rate for each activity cost pool
3: Allocate overhead costs to cost objects

Activity Cost Driver: causes cost of an activity to go up or down.

| Activity | Budgeted Cost | Activity Cost Driver | Budgeted Activity Usage | 
(
| Production | $600000 | Direct Labor Hours | 100000 Direct Labor Hours
);

Computing Activity Rate: 
| Activity Cost Driver | Actual Activity Usage |
(
| Direct Labor Hours | 75000 standard | 25000 custom | Total 100000
| Setups | 40 standard | 160 custom | Total 200

Dollar Sales at Target Income = Fixed Costs + Target Income / Contribution Margin Ratio

Unit Sales at Target Income = Fixed Costs + Target Income / Contribution Margin per Unit

Measuring Cost Behavior:

1. Scatter Diagram: graph of unit volume and cost data
2. High-Low Method
--- Step 1: Identify Highest and Lowest volume levels
--- Step 2: Compute the slope
--- Step 3: Compute the total fixed costs

Variable Cost per Units = Change In Cost / Change in Units

Total Cost = Fixed Cost + (Variable Cost per Units * Number of Units)

3. Regression (least squares regression):
- Through statistical methods Implemented in Spreadsheet 

Comparisons:
- High Low is useful for quick cost estimates; Regression is more accurate

Break Even Point:
- When Total Costs equal total Sales: 0 income.
- Applicable to all orgs and events
- Expressed in units or sales
- Can be determined by:
1.  Forumla Method
- BreakEven(units) = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin per Unit
- BreakEven(dollars) = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin Ratio

2. Contribution Margin Income Statement

3. Cost-Volume-Profit Chart

Sales Mix and BreakEven:

Weighted-AVG Contribution Margin per Unit = Contribution Margin per Unit for Each Product * Sales Mix Percent for Each product.
| Soft Hats => sell for $15, Var $5, 80%

- The products absorb costs during creation process, to include Direct Materials, Direct Labor, Variable Overhead, and could absorb Fixed Overhead... BUT

- Because Fixed Overhead can remain, the volume of an order may generate profit. Fixed Overhead is treated as an Period Cost, not a Product Cost. 

- Under Absorption Costing, Fixed Overhead can be treated as a Product Cost for the Business, but under Variable Costing, it would be treated as a Period Expense (in period Income Statement)

- An Income Statement w/ Variable Costing is considered a Contribution Margin Income Statement: 
| Sales
| Variable Expenses
| Variable Cost of Goods Sold
| Variable Selling and Administrative Expenses
| Contribution Margin

- When # Units Produced differs from # Units Produced Sold: Inventory Levels Change; $ Amount of Finished Goods Inventory on the Balance Sheet will differ too. Absorption Costing includes Fixed Overhead inside Cost of Goods Sold ONLY for what was sold. Variable Costing won't include the Fixed Overhead as part of Finished Goods Inventory

$prod = 1000
#sold = 750
fOverhead = 30000
___ 30000/750 = 40 per unit
vProd = 25 *750 = 18750
vAdmin = (10 * 750) = 7500
fAdmin = 15000

Planning Production
- based on reliable sales forecasts

Absorption Costing can bloat Income when Units Produced are higher than Units Sold; this would drive down the Cost of Goods Sold; this is related to the Manger Incentive Problem, where finished goods inventory assets and higher income rationalize bonuses.

To Determine Selling Prices:
1. Determine Product Cost per Unit using Absorption Costing
2. Determine Target Markup on Product Cost per Unit
3. Add Target Markup on the Product Cost to find the Target Selling Price (% of Absorption Cost) 

Variable Cost is good for Special Orders;
Fixed Costs do not change in the Short Run;

<mark class="formula">CM = Sales - Variable Expenses</mark>
<mark class="formula">CM Ratio = CM / Sales</mark>

10) Revisit CoGS (Fixed OH is based on Units Produced)
11) Variable Selling is not included in Finished Goods	`

Budgetary Control
- Budgets are plans in dollars, usually for short-medium term goals.
- Steps:
1. Develop Budget
2. Compare Actual to Budget
3. Take Action
4. Set New Plans
- Benefits: 
1. Plan: focuses on future opportunities and threats
2. Control: requires management evaluate operations against some norm
3. Coordinate: helps achieve goals across departments
4. Communicate: communicates action plans to all employees
5. Motivate: motivates employees:
- Participatory, Attainable, Evaluation needed for positivity. 
- Could lead to understating sales budgets and overstating expense budgets to allow for cushion
- Could spur fraud or unethical behavior.
- Could spur spending of full amount to ensure future budgets aren't reduced.

Annual Budget: usually FY-based; separated into quarterly or monthly etc. Monthly or quarterly budgets can be rolled as time passes. 
Rolled Budgets: revises entire set of budgets as a quarterly budget elapses.	`
